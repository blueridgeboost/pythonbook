<h1 id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>By David Beazley</p>
<p>As an educator, researcher, and book author, I am delighted to see the
completion of this book. Python is a fun and extremely easy-to-use programming
language that has steadily gained in popularity over the last few years.
Developed over ten years ago by Guido van Rossum, Python’s simple syntax and
overall feel is largely derived from ABC, a teaching language that was
developed in the 1980’s. However, Python was also created to solve real
problems and it borrows a wide variety of features from programming languages
such as C++, Java, Modula-3, and Scheme. Because of this, one of Python’s most
remarkable features is its broad appeal to professional software developers,
scientists, researchers, artists, and educators.</p>
<p>Despite Python’s appeal to many different communities, you may still wonder why
Python? or why teach programming with Python? Answering these questions is no
simple task—especially when popular opinion is on the side of more
masochistic alternatives such as C++ and Java.  However, I think the most
direct answer is that programming in Python is simply a lot of fun and more
productive.</p>
<p>When I teach computer science courses, I want to cover important concepts in
addition to making the material interesting and engaging to students.
Unfortunately, there is a tendency for introductory programming courses to
focus far too much attention on mathematical abstraction and for students to
become frustrated with annoying problems related to low-level details of
syntax, compilation, and the enforcement of seemingly arcane rules. Although
such abstraction and formalism is important to professional software engineers
and students who plan to continue their study of computer science, taking such
an approach in an introductory course mostly succeeds in making computer
science boring. When I teach a course, I don’t want to have a room of
uninspired students. I would much rather see them trying to solve interesting
problems by exploring different ideas, taking unconventional approaches,
breaking the rules, and learning from their mistakes. In doing so, I don’t want
to waste half of the semester trying to sort out obscure syntax problems,
unintelligible compiler error messages, or the several hundred ways that a
program might generate a general protection fault.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I like Python is that it provides a really nice balance
between the practical and the conceptual. Since Python is interpreted,
beginners can pick up the language and start doing neat things almost
immediately without getting lost in the problems of compilation and linking.
Furthermore, Python comes with a large library of modules that can be used to
do all sorts of tasks ranging from web-programming to graphics. Having such a
practical focus is a great way to engage students and it allows them to
complete significant projects. However, Python can also serve as an excellent
foundation for introducing important computer science concepts. Since Python
fully supports procedures and classes, students can be gradually introduced to
topics such as procedural abstraction, data structures, and object-oriented
programming — all of which are applicable to later courses on Java or C++.
Python even borrows a number of features from functional programming languages
and can be used to introduce concepts that would be covered in more detail in
courses on Scheme and Lisp.</p>
<p>In reading Jeffrey’s preface, I am struck by his comments that Python allowed
him to see a higher level of success and a lower level of frustration and that
he was able to move faster with better results.  Although these comments refer
to his introductory course, I sometimes use Python for these exact same reasons
in advanced graduate level computer science courses at the University of
Chicago. In these courses, I am constantly faced with the daunting task of
covering a lot of difficult course material in a blistering nine week quarter.
Although it is certainly possible for me to inflict a lot of pain and suffering
by using a language like C++, I have often found this approach to be
counterproductive—especially when the course is about a topic unrelated to
just programming. I find that using Python allows me to better focus on the
actual topic at hand while allowing students to complete substantial class
projects.</p>
<p>Although Python is still a young and evolving language, I believe that it has a
bright future in education. This book is an important step in that direction.</p>
