Recall that the ```for``` loop processes each item in a list.  Each item in
turn is (re-)assigned to the loop variable, and the body of the loop is executed.
We saw this example in an earlier chapter:

```
for f in ["Joe", "Zoe", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    invitation = "Hi " + f + ".  Please come to my party on Saturday!"
    print(invitation)</textarea>
```

Running through all the items in a list is called **traversing** the list,
or **traversal**.

Let us write a function now to sum up all the elements in a list of numbers.
Do this by hand first, and try to isolate exactly what steps you take.  You&#8217;ll
find you need to keep some &#8220;running total&#8221; of the sum so far, either on a piece
of paper, in your head, or in your calculator. Remembering things from one step to the next is
precisely why we have variables in a program: so we&#8217;ll need some variable
to remember the &#8220;running total&#8221;.  It should be initialized with a value of zero,
and then we need to traverse the items in the list.  For each item, we&#8217;ll want
to update the running total by adding the next number to it.

```
def mysum(xs):
    """ Sum all the numbers in the list xs, and return the total. """
    running_total = 0
    for x in xs:
       running_total = running_total + x
    return running_total

# Add tests like these to your test suite ...
print(mysum([1, 2, 3, 4])) # should be 10
print(mysum([1.25, 2.5, 1.75])) # should be 5.5
print(mysum([1, -2, 3])) # should be 2
print(mysum([ ])) # should be 0
print(mysum(range(11))) # should be 0+1+2+...+10 = 55</textarea>
```
