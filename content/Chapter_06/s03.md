Let's start with the code from the end of the last section.

```
def print_multiples(n):
    for i in range(1, 7):
        print(n * i, end="   ")
    print()

def print_mult_table():
    for i in range(1, 7):
        print_multiples(i)

print_mult_table()
```

You might be wondering how we can use the same variable, ```i```, in both
```print_multiples``` and ```print_mult_table```. Doesn&#8217;t it cause problems when
one of the functions changes the value of the variable?

The answer is no, because the ```i``` in ```print_multiples``` and the ```i``` in
```print_mult_table``` are *not* the same variable.

Variables created inside a function definition are local; you can&#8217;t access a
local variable from outside its home function. That means you are free to have
multiple variables with the same name as long as they are not in the same
function.

Python examines all the statements in a function &#8212; if any of them assign a value
to a variable, that is the clue that Python uses to make the variable a local variable.

The stack diagram for this program shows that the two variables named ```i``` are
not the same variable. They can refer to different values, and changing one
does not affect the other.

The value of ```i``` in ```print_mult_table``` goes from 1 to 6. In the diagram it
happens to be 3. The next time through the loop it will be 4. Each time through
the loop, ```print_mult_table``` calls ```print_multiples``` with the current value
of ```i``` as an argument. That value gets assigned to the parameter ```n```.

Inside ```print_multiples```, the value of ```i``` goes from 1 to 6. In the
diagram, it happens to be 2. Changing this variable has no effect on the value
of ```i``` in ```print_mult_table```.

It is common and perfectly legal to have different local variables with the
same name. In particular, names like ```i``` and ```j``` are used frequently as
loop variables. If you avoid using them in one function just because you used
them somewhere else, you will probably make the program harder to read.
