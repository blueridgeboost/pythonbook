The pre-test loop is standard loop behavior. 

```for``` and ```while``` loops do their tests at the start, before executing any part of the body. Theyâ€™re called pre-test loops, because the test happens before (pre) the body. break and return are our tools for adapting this standard behavior.

Sometimes we&#8217;d like to have the **middle-test** loop with the exit test in the middle
of the body, rather than at the beginning or at the end.  Or a **post-test** loop that
puts its exit test as the last thing in the body. Other languages have different
syntax and keywords for these different flavours, but Python just uses
a combination of ```while``` and ```if condition: break``` to get the job done.

A typical example is a problem where the user has to input numbers to be summed.
To indicate that there are no more inputs, the user enters a special value, often
the value -1, or the empty string.  This needs a middle-exit loop pattern:
input the next number, then test whether to exit, or else process the number:


The middle-test loop flowchart

```
total = 0
while True:
    response = input("Enter the next number. (Leave blank to end)")
    if response == "":
        break
    total += int(response)
print("The total of the numbers you entered is "+str(total))
```


Convince yourself that this fits the middle-exit loop flowchart: line 3
does some useful work, lines 4 and 5 can exit the loop, and if they don&#8217;t
line 6 does more useful work before the next iteration starts.

The ```while bool-expr:``` uses the Boolean expression to determine whether to iterate again.
```True``` is a trivial Boolean expression, so ```while True:```  means *always do
the loop body again*.  This is a language *idiom* &#8212; a convention that
most programmers will recognize immediately. Since the expression on line 2
will never terminate the loop, (it is a dummy test) the programmer must arrange to
break (or return) out of the loop body elsewhere, in some other way (i.e. in lines 4 and 5 in
this sample).

Similarly, by just moving the ```if condition: break``` to the end of the loop body we
create a pattern for a post-test loop.  Post-test loops are used when you want to
be sure that the loop body always executes at least once (because the first test
only happens at the end of the execution of the first loop body).
This is useful, for example, if we want to play an interactive game against
the user &#8212; we always want to play at least one game:

```
while True:
    play_the_game_once()
    response = input("Play again? (yes or no)")
    if response != "yes":
        break
print("Goodbye!")
```
Hint: Think about where you want the exit test to happen

Once you&#8217;ve recognized that you need a loop to repeat something, think
about its terminating condition &#8212; when will I want to stop iterating?
Then figure out whether you need to do the test before starting
the first (and every other) iteration, or at the end of
the first (and every other) iteration, or perhaps in
the middle of each iteration.  Interactive programs that require input
from the user or read from files often need to exit their loops in the
middle or at the end of an iteration, when it becomes clear that there is
no more data to process, or the user doesn&#8217;t want to play our game anymore.
