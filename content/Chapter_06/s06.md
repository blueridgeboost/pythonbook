Use a ```for``` loop if you know, before you start looping,
the maximum number of times that you&#8217;ll need to execute the body.
For example, if you&#8217;re traversing a list of elements, you know that the maximum
number of loop iterations you can possibly need is &#8220;all the elements in the list&#8221;.
Or if you need to print the 12 times table, we know right away how many times
the loop will need to run.

So any problem like &#8220;iterate this weather model for 1000 cycles&#8221;, or &#8220;search this
list of words&#8221;, &#8220;find all prime numbers up to 10000&#8221; suggest that a ```for``` loop is best.

By contrast, if you are required to repeat some computation until some condition is
met, and you cannot calculate in advance when (of if) this will happen,
as we did in this 3n + 1 problem, you&#8217;ll need a ```while``` loop.

<p class="last">We call the first case **definite iteration** &#8212; we know ahead of time some definite bounds for
what is needed.  The latter case is called **indefinite iteration** &#8212; we&#8217;re not sure
how many iterations we&#8217;ll need &#8212; we cannot even establish an upper bound!
