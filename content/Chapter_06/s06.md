The ```continue``` statement is a control flow statement that causes the program to immediately skip the processing of the rest of the body of
the loop, for the current iteration. But the loop still carries on running for its remaining iterations:

```
for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29, 30]:
    if i % 2 == 1:  # If the number is odd
        continue    # Don't process it
    print(i)
print("done")
```

The program prints:
```
12
16
24
30
done
```
