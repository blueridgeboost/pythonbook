The break statement is used to immediately leave the body of its loop. The next statement to be executed is the first one after the body:

```
for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29]:
    if i % 2 == 1:  # If the number is odd
        break        #  ... immediately exit the loop
    print(i)
print("done")
```
