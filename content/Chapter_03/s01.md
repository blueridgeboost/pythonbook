## Our first turtle program

Let&#8217;s write a couple of lines of Python program to create a new
turtle and start drawing a rectangle. (We&#8217;ll call the variable that
refers to our first turtle ```alex```, but we can choose another
name if we follow the naming rules from the previous chapter).

To use the turtle library in a Collab Jupyter notebook, we start by installing the library.

**You will have to execute this cell every time you restart a new session.**

```
!pip install ColabTurtlePlus
```

Here is a first program we will analyze together.

```
import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle # Allows us to use turtles

turtle.clearscreen()                    # Remove drawings from previous runs.
turtle.setup(200,100)                   # Sets the dimensions of the viewing window.

alex = turtle.Turtle()                  # Create a turtle, assign to alex

alex.forward(50)                        # Tell alex to move forward by 50 units
alex.left(90)                           # Tell alex to turn left by 90 degrees
alex.forward(30)                        # Complete the second side of a rectangle

```

Here are a couple of things we will need to understand about this program. (Do not worry if you do not understand them all now&#8212; we will cover them in more detail as we work through the book.)


The first line, ```import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle```,
tells Python to load a module named ```ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle``` that will be used in this notebook with the name ```turtle```. 
That module brings us a new type that we can use: the ```Turtle``` type.  The dot
notation ```turtle.Turtle``` means *&#8220;The Turtle type that is defined within
the turtle module&#8221;*.   (Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the
module name, with a lowercase *t*, is different from the type ```Turtle```.)

We then clear the screen to remove drawings from previous runs with ```turtle.clearscreen()``` and set the dimensions to a size that is big enough for the drawing with ```turtle.setup(200,100)```.

In the next line, ```alex = turtle.Turtle()```,  we create a turtle and assign it to the variable ```alex```.

Now we are ready to draw on the canvas using the turtle.
```
alex.forward(50)    # Tell alex to move forward by 50 units
alex.left(90)       # Tell alex to turn left by 90 degrees
alex.forward(30)    # Complete the second side of a rectangle
```

In the last three lines, we instruct the **object** ```alex``` to move, and to turn. We
do this by **invoking**, or activating, ```alex```&#8216;s **methods** &#8212; these are
the instructions that all turtles know how to respond to.

Running the program produces the output below.
