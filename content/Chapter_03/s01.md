## Our first turtle program

To use the turtle library in a Collab Jupyter notebook, we start by
installing the library.

**You will have to execute this cell every time you restart a new session.**

```Python
!pip install ColabTurtlePlus
```

With the turtle library, we can draw by moving a virtual turtle around
the screen.  Let&#8217;s write a couple of lines of Python program to
create a new turtle and start drawing a rectangle. (We&#8217;ll call
the variable that refers to our first turtle ```shelly```, but you can
choose any name you want so long as it follows the Python variable
naming rules from the previous chapter).

Here is a first program we will analyze together:

```Python
import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle	  # Imports the turtle library

turtle.clearscreen()                      # Remove drawings from previous runs.
turtle.setup(200, 100)                    # Sets the dimensions of the viewing window.

shelly = turtle.Turtle()                  # Create a turtle, assign to shelly

shelly.forward(50)                        # Tell shelly to move forward by 50 units
shelly.left(90)                           # Tell shelly to turn left by 90 degrees
shelly.forward(30)                        # Complete the second side of a rectangle
```

Here are a couple of things we will need to understand about this program. (Do not worry if you do not understand them all now&#8212; we will cover them in more detail as we work through the book.)


The first line, ```import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle```,
tells Python to load a module (we also this a _library_) named ```ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle``` that will be used in this notebook with the name ```turtle```.

The turtle library defines a new type, ```Turtle``` that has operations like ```forward()``` for moving the a turtle.  The dot
notation ```turtle.Turtle``` means *&#8220;The Turtle type that is defined within
the turtle module&#8221;*.   (Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the
module name, with a lowercase *t*, is different from the type ```Turtle```.)

The next line clears the screen to remove drawings from previous runs with ```turtle.clearscreen()``` and set the dimensions to a size that is big enough for the drawing with ```turtle.setup(200,100)```.

Then, ```shelly = turtle.Turtle()``` creates a new turtle and assigns it to the variable ```shelly```.

Now we are ready to draw using the turtle:
```Python
shelly.forward(50)    # Tell shelly to move forward by 50 units
shelly.left(90)       # Tell shelly to turn left by 90 degrees
shelly.forward(30)    # Complete the second side of a rectangle
```

These lines instruct the Turtle **object** that the ```shelly```
variable references to move, and to turn. We do this by **invoking**,
or calling, **methods** of that Turtle object. Methods are functions defined by the turtle library that can be called on Turtle objects. Here, the ```forward``` method takes a parameter that gives the distance, and the Turtle object will move that distance in the direction it is pointing. The ```left``` method causes the Turtle object to turn so it is now facing a new direction.

Running the program produces the output below.
