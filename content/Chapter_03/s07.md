## Project: A Turtle Bar Chart

Now we're going to put together many of the things we've learned to write a program that uses a turtle to draw a bar chart.

Let's start with some data to be charted:

```xs = [48, 117, 200, 240, 160, 260, 220]```

Corresponding to each data measurement, we&#8217;ll draw a rectangle
of that height, with a fixed width.  We&#8217;re showing off a new
programming concept called a *function* in the example below:
we&#8217;re defining the function ```draw_bar``` to draw a bar of our
graph. We&#8217;ll generally want to use a function to encode a
complicated task that we&#8217;ll want to repeat many times (like
drawing a bar in a bar graph). You can probably guess how functions
work from this code, but we won't explain it here &mdash; we're going to discuss functions in a
lot more detail in the next chapter.

```Python
def draw_bar(t, h):
    """ Get turtle t to draw one bar, of height h. """
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(h)          # Draw up the left side
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(40)         # Width of bar, along the top
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(h)          # ...and down again!

    t.left(90)            # Put the turtle facing the way we found it.
    t.forward(10)         # Leave small gap after each bar
```

This function draws one bar, taking a Turtle object and height as its input.

To draw bar for all of the data, we loop through the data drawing each bar:
```Python
for v in xs:              
    draw_bar(shelly, v)
```

The important thing here was the mental chunking, or how we broke the
problem into smaller pieces. Our chunk is to draw one bar, and we
wrote a function to do that. Then, for the whole chart, we repeatedly
called our function.

Here's our full first version of the graphing program:
```Python
import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle

xs = [48, 117, 200, 240, 160, 260, 220] # our data

def draw_bar(t, h):
    """ Get turtle t to draw one bar, of height h. """
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(h)          # Draw up the left side
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(40)         # Width of bar, along the top
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(h)          # And down again!

    t.left(90)            # Put the turtle facing the way we found it.
    t.forward(10)         # Leave small gap after each bar

turtle.clearscreen()  
turtle.setup(400,400)
turtle.bgcolor("lightgreen")

shelly = turtle.Turtle()
shelly.penup()
shelly.goto(-190, -190)
shelly.pendown()
shelly.color("blue")
shelly.fillcolor("darkblue")

for v in xs:             
    draw_bar(shelly, v)
```

Note that we used a new ```goto``` method to move the turtle to the bottom left of the canvas before starting to draw the bar graph. Try running the code without the ```goto``` to see what happens.

### Improving the Bar Graph

The nice thing about defining a function ```draw_bar``` to draw each
bar, is that if we want to improve the bars we can just change this
function and all of the bars will improve!

We'll modify it to print out the value of the data as the bar is drawn, and to fill in the bar with color.

```
import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle

xs = [48, 117, 200, 240, 160, 260, 220] # our data

def draw_bar(t, h):
    """ Get turtle t to draw one bar, of height h. """
    t.begin_fill()                # Start of the fill area
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(h)                  # Draw up the left side
    t.write("  " + str(h))        # Write the data
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(40)                 # Width of bar, along the top
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(h)                  # and down again!
    t.left(90)                    # Put the turtle facing the way started
    t.end_fill()                  # Fill in the bar
    t.forward(10)                 # Leave small gap after each bar

turtle.clearscreen()  
turtle.setup(400,400)
turtle.bgcolor("lightgreen")

shelly = turtle.Turtle()
shelly.penup()
shelly.goto(-190, -190)
shelly.pendown()
shelly.color("blue")
shelly.fillcolor("darkblue")

for v in xs:              # Draw a bar for each number in the data
    draw_bar(shelly, v)
```

### Your Turn

Perhaps the bars should not be joined to each other at the
bottom?  We&#8217;ll need to pick up the pen while making the gap
between the bars.

**Color Challenge:** Maybe the bars should be different colors &mdash; can
you change the drawing code so each bar is a different color? There
are lots of different ways you could do this, some would involve
changing ```draw_bar``` but others would just change the code inside
the for loop. Which is better?

**Big Data Challenge:** The code now uses fixed values of ```40``` for the
width of the bar and ```10``` for the gap between each bar. If we want
to graph a lot of data, though, we would need to make the bars
smaller. Can you figure out a way to make a graph with 10 bars that
still fits on the canvas?  What about changing the code so it will
work for any number of bars?
