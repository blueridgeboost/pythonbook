## Condensing our Turtle Program using Loops

To draw a square we&#8217;d like to do the same thing four times
&#8212; move the turtle, and turn left 90 degrees.  We previously used
8 lines to have ```alex``` draw the four sides of a square.

This does exactly the same, but using just three lines with a **for** loop:

```Python 
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:       # Draw the four sides of the square
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.mainloop()
```


Some observations:

<ul class="simple">
<li>While &#8220;saving some lines of code&#8221; might be convenient, it is not the big deal here.
What is much more important is that we&#8217;ve found a &#8220;repeating pattern&#8221; of statements,
and reorganized our program to repeat the pattern.  Finding the chunks and somehow
getting our programs arranged around those chunks is a vital
skill in computational thinking.</li>
<li>

The values ```[0, 1, 2, 3]``` were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times.
We could
have used any four values, but these are the conventional ones to use. In fact, getting a list of numbers in order is so useful that Python provides a built-in way to do this using ```range```:


```Python
for i in range(4):
    # Executes the body with i = 0, then 1, then 2, then 3
    print("i = " + str(i))
for i in range(10):
    # Sets i to each of ... [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    print("i = " + str(i))
```
<li>

Computer scientists like to count from 0 &mdash; this is why ```range(n)``` goes through the numbers from ```0``` up to ```n - 1```.
</li>

<li>

Our little trick earlier to make sure that ```alex``` did the final turn to complete
360 degrees has paid off: if we had not done that, then we would not have been
able to use a loop for the fourth side of the square.
It would have become a &#8220;special case&#8221;,
different from the other sides.  When possible, we&#8217;d much prefer to make
our code fit a general pattern, rather than have to create a special case.</li>
</ul>

So to repeat something four times, a Python programmer would do this:


```Python
for _ in range(4):	# here, we use _ instead of i since we don't actually need the value
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)
```


By now you should be able to see how to change our previous program so that
```tess``` can also use a ```for``` loop to draw her equilateral triangle.

But now, what would happen if we made the change below? Try to figure out what&#8217;s going to happen, then run the code to see if you&#8217;re right!


```Python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

for c in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
    alex.color(c)
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.mainloop()
```

A variable can also be assigned a value that is a list.  So lists can also be used in
more general situations, not only in the ```for``` loop.  The code above could be rewritten like this:

```Python
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

clrs = ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]
for c in clrs:
    alex.color(c)
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.mainloop()
```
