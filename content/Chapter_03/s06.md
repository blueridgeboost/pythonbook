### No Need to Be Positive
 
Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances.  So ```shelly.forward(-100)```
will move ```shelly``` backwards, and ```shelly.left(-30)``` turns her to the right.  Additionally,
because there are 360 degrees in a circle, turning 30 to the left will get ```shelly``` facing
in the same direction as turning 330 to the right!  The on-screen animation will differ,
though &#8212; you will be able to tell if ```shelly``` is turning clockwise or counter-clockwise!

We do not need both a left and a right turn method &#8212; we could be
minimalists, and just have one method.  But, it there's no limit on the methods a module can define and its convenient to have both so the turtle library provides both ```left``` and ```right``` turn methods, as well as ```forward``` and ```backward```.  (If you are very adventurous, you might enjoy using ```shelly.backward(-100)``` to
move ```shelly``` forward!)

Part of *thinking like a computer scientist* is to understand more of the structure and rich
relationships in our field.  So revising a few basic facts about
geometry and number lines, and spotting the relationships between left, right,
backward, forward, negative and positive distances or angles values is a good start.

### Moving without Drawing

A turtle&#8217;s pen can be picked up or put down.  This allows us to
move a turtle to a different place without drawing a line.  The
methods are ```penup``` and ```pendown```.

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)

shelly = turtle.Turtle()    # Create shelly

shelly.penup()
shelly.forward(100)         # This moves shelly, but no line is drawn
shelly.pendown()

turtle.mainloop()
```

### Squashing Turtles

Every turtle can have its own shape.  The shapes available are ```arrow```, ```blank```, ```circle```, ```classic```, ```square```, ```triangle```, ```turtle```.

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen()        # Creates a playground for turtles
turtle.setup(200, 100) 

shelly = turtle.Turtle()    # Create a turtle, assign to shelly
shelly.shape("turtle")      # Shape shelly to look like a turtle

shelly.forward(50)          # Tell shelly to move forward by 50 units
shelly.left(90)             # Tell shelly to turn by 90 degrees
shelly.forward(30)          # Complete the second side of a rectangle

turtle.mainloop()
```

### Animation

Part of the fun of drawing with turtles is that we don't see the drawing appear instantly, but see the turtle move to draw. We can speed up or slow down the turtle&#8217;s speed for both turning and moving.  Speed settings can be set
between ```1``` (slowest) to ```10``` (fastest).  But if we set the speed to ```0```, it has
a special meaning &#8212; turn off animation and go as fast as possible.

A turtle can &#8220;stamp&#8221; its footprint onto the canvas,
and this will remain after the turtle has moved somewhere else.
Stamping works, even when the pen is up.

The code below shows some examples using these methods:

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen()        # Creates a playground for turtles
turtle.setup(600, 600) 
turtle.bgcolor("lightgreen")

shelly = turtle.Turtle()
shelly.shape("turtle")
shelly.color("blue")

shelly.penup()
size = 20
for _ in range(30):
    shelly.stamp()             # Leave an impression on the canvas
    size = size + 3            # Increase the size on every iteration
    shelly.forward(size)       # Move shelly along
    shelly.right(24)           #  ...  and turn her
    
turtle.mainloop()
```

How many times was the body of the loop executed?

How many turtle images are on the screen?

All except one of the shapes we see on the screen here are footprints
created by ```stamp```.  But the program still only has *one* turtle
object &#8212; can you figure out which one here is the real
```shelly```?  (Hint: if you&#8217;re not sure, write a new line of
code after the ```for``` loop to change ```shelly```&#8216; color.)

### Writing Text

We can get a turtle to display text on the canvas at the turtle&#8217;s current position.  The method to do that is called ```write```:

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen()
turtle.setup(200,200)        # Creates a playground for turtles
shelly = turtle.Turtle()    # Create a turtle, assign to shelly

shelly.forward(50)          # Tell shelly to move forward by 50 units
shelly.left(90)             # Tell shelly to turn by 90 degrees
shelly.forward(30)          # Complete the second side of a rectangle

shelly.write("Hi there!")   # Write a message

turtle.mainloop()
```

### Filling Shapes

We can fill a shape (circle, semicircle, triangle, etc.) with a color.  It is a two-step process.
First, we call the method ```shelly.begin_fill()```, then we draw the shape, then we call ```shelly.end_fill()```.  
Below is an example of this using our square example from earlier.

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen()
turtle.setup(200,200)        # Creates a playground for turtles
shelly = turtle.Turtle()      # Create shelly

shelly.begin_fill()           # Start of the region to fill
for i in range(4):            # Draw the four sides of the square
    shelly.forward(50)
    shelly.left(90)
shelly.end_fill()             # Fill the region

turtle.mainloop()
```

We have previously set the color of our turtle. We can now also set its fill color, which need not
be the same as the turtle and the pen color.  We use the ```fillcolor``` method to set the
turtle's fill color:

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen()
turtle.setup(200,200)        # Creates a playground for turtles
shelly = turtle.Turtle()      # Create shelly
shelly.color("blue")          # Set pen color to blue
shelly.fillcolor("red")       # Set fill color to red

shelly.begin_fill()           # Start of the region to fill
for i in range(4):            # Draw the four sides of the square
    shelly.forward(50)
    shelly.left(90)
shelly.end_fill()             # Fill the region

turtle.mainloop()
```
