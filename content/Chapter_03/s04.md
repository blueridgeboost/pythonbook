## The **for** Loop

When we drew the square, it was quite tedious.  We had to explicitly repeat the steps of
moving and turning four times.  If we were drawing a hexagon, an octogon, or a
enneacontaenneagon (that's a polygon with 99 sides!), it would have been worse.

So a basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some
code, over and over again.

Python&#8217;s **for** loop does this.   Let&#8217;s say we have some friends, and
we&#8217;d like to send them each an email inviting them to our party.  We don&#8217;t
quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we&#8217;ll just print a message for each friend:


```Python 
for f in ["Joe","Zoe","Brad","Angelina","Zuki","Thandi","Paris"]:
    invite = "Hi " + f + ". Please come to my party on Saturday!"
    print(invite)
# more code can follow here ...
```

<ul class="simple">

<li>

The variable ```f``` in the ```for``` statement at line 1 is called the **loop variable**. We could have chosen any other variable name instead.</li>
<li>

Lines 2 and 3 are the **loop body**.  The loop body is always
indented. The convention is to use 4 spaces of indentation for our loop bodies. The indentation determines exactly what statements are &#8220;in the body of the loop&#8221;.</li>
<li>

On each *iteration* or *pass* of the loop, first a check is done to see if there are
still more items to be processed.  If there are none left (this is called
the **terminating condition** of the loop), the loop has finished.
Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body, (e.g. in this case
the next statement below the comment in line 4).</li>
<li>

If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to refer to the
next item in the list.  This means, in this case, that the loop body is executed
here 7 times, and each time ```f``` will refer to a different friend.</li>
<li>

At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns
to the ```for``` statement, to see if there are more items to be handled, and to assign the
next one to ```f```.</li>
</ul>

## Execution of a **for** Loop

As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is
about to be executed.  We call this the **control flow**, of the **flow of execution**
of the program.  When humans execute programs, they often use their finger to point
to each statement in turn.  So we could think of control flow as &#8220;Python&#8217;s moving finger&#8221;.

Control flow until now has been strictly
top to bottom, one statement at a time.  The ```for``` loop changes this.

Control flow is often easy to visualize and understand if we draw a flowchart.
This shows the exact steps and logic of how the ```for``` statement executes.
