## The **for** loop

When we drew the square, it was quite tedious.  We had to explicitly repeat the steps of
moving and turning four times.  If we were drawing a hexagon, or an octogon,
or a polygon with 42 sides, it would have been worse.

So a basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some code, over and
over again.

Python&#8217;s **for** loop solves this for us.   Let&#8217;s say we have some friends, and
we&#8217;d like to send them each an email inviting them to our party.  We don&#8217;t
quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we&#8217;ll just print a message for each friend:


```
for f in ["Joe","Zoe","Brad","Angelina","Zuki","Thandi","Paris"]:
    invite = "Hi " + f + ". Please come to my party on Saturday!"
    print(invite)
# more code can follow here ...
```

<ul class="simple">
<li>The variable ```f``` in the ```for``` statement at line 1 is called the **loop variable**.
We could have chosen any other variable name instead.</li>
<li>Lines 2 and 3 are the **loop body**.  The loop body is always
indented. The convention is to use 4 spaces of indentation for our loop bodies. The indentation determines exactly what statements are &#8220;in the body of the loop&#8221;.</li>
<li>On each *iteration* or *pass* of the loop, first a check is done to see if there are
still more items to be processed.  If there are none left (this is called
the **terminating condition** of the loop), the loop has finished.
Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body, (e.g. in this case
the next statement below the comment in line 4).</li>
<li>If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to refer to the
next item in the list.  This means, in this case, that the loop body is executed
here 7 times, and each time ```f``` will refer to a different friend.</li>
<li>At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns
to the ```for``` statement, to see if there are more items to be handled, and to assign the
next one to ```f```.</li>
</ul>

## Flow of Execution of the for loop

As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is
about to be executed.  We call this the **control flow**, of the **flow of execution**
of the program.  When humans execute programs, they often use their finger to point
to each statement in turn.  So we could think of control flow as &#8220;Python&#8217;s moving finger&#8221;.

Control flow until now has been strictly
top to bottom, one statement at a time.  The ```for``` loop changes this.

Flowchart of a **for** loop

Control flow is often easy to visualize and understand if we draw a flowchart.
This shows the exact steps and logic of how the ```for``` statement executes.

## The loop simplifies our turtle program

To draw a square we&#8217;d like to do the same thing four times &#8212; move the turtle, and turn.
We previously used 8 lines to have ```alex``` draw the four sides of a square.
This does exactly the same, but using just three lines:

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

for i in [0,1,2,3]:          # Draw the four sides of the square
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.mainloop()
```


Some observations:

<ul class="simple">
<li>While &#8220;saving some lines of code&#8221; might be convenient, it is not the big deal here.
What is much more important is that we&#8217;ve found a &#8220;repeating pattern&#8221; of statements,
and reorganized our program to repeat the pattern.  Finding the chunks and somehow
getting our programs arranged around those chunks is a vital
skill in computational thinking.</li>
<li>The values [0,1,2,3] were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times.
We could
have used any four values, but these are the conventional ones to use.  In fact, they are
so popular that Python gives us special built-in ```range``` objects:</li>
</ul>

```
for i in range(4):
    # Executes the body with i = 0, then 1, then 2, then 3
    print("i = "+str(i))
for x in range(10):
    # Sets x to each of ... [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    print("x = "+str(x))
```


<ul class="simple">
<li>Computer scientists like to count from 0!</li>
<li>```range``` can deliver a sequence of values to the loop variable in the ```for``` loop.
They start at 0, and in these cases do not include the 4 or the 10.</li>
<li>Our little trick earlier to make sure that ```alex``` did the final turn to complete
360 degrees has paid off: if we had not done that, then we would not have been
able to use a loop for the fourth side of the square.
It would have become a &#8220;special case&#8221;,
different from the other sides.  When possible, we&#8217;d much prefer to make
our code fit a general pattern, rather than have to create a special case.</li>
</ul>
So to repeat something four times, a good Python programmer would do this:


```
for i in range(4):
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)
```


By now you should be able to see how to change our previous program so that
```tess``` can also use a ```for``` loop to draw her equilateral triangle.

But now, what would happen if we made the change below? Try to figure out what&#8217;s going to happen, then run the code to see if you&#8217;re right!


```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

for c in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
    alex.color(c)
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.mainloop()
```

A variable can also be assigned a value that is a list.  So lists can also be used in
more general situations, not only in the ```for``` loop.  The code above could be rewritten like this:

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

clrs = ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]
for c in clrs:
    alex.color(c)
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.mainloop()
```


## A few more turtle methods and tricks

Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances.  So ```tess.forward(-100)```
will move ```tess``` backwards, and ```tess.left(-30)``` turns her to the right.  Additionally,
because there are 360 degrees in a circle, turning 30 to the left will get ```tess``` facing
in the same direction as turning 330 to the right!  (The on-screen animation will differ,
though &#8212; you will be able to tell if ```tess``` is turning clockwise or counter-clockwise!)

This suggests that we don&#8217;t need both a left and a right turn method &#8212; we could be
minimalists, and just have one method.  There is also a *backward*
method.  (If you are very nerdy, you might enjoy saying ```alex.backward(-100)``` to
move ```alex``` forward!)

Part of *thinking like a computer scientist* is to understand more of the structure and rich
relationships in our field.  So revising a few basic facts about
geometry and number lines, and spotting the relationships between left, right,
backward, forward, negative and positive distances or angles values is a good start
if we&#8217;re going to play with turtles.

A turtle&#8217;s pen can be picked up or put down.  This allows us to move a turtle
to a different place without drawing a line.   The methods are


```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

alex.penup()
alex.forward(100)     # This moves alex, but no line is drawn
alex.pendown()

wn.mainloop()

Every turtle can have its own shape.  The shapes available are ```arrow```, ```blank```, ```circle```, ```classic```, ```square```, ```triangle```, ```turtle```.

```
import turtle             # Allows us to use turtles
wn = turtle.Screen()      # Creates a playground for turtles
alex = turtle.Turtle()    # Create a turtle, assign to alex

alex.shape("turtle")      # Shape alex to look like a turtle

alex.forward(50)          # Tell alex to move forward by 50 units
alex.left(90)             # Tell alex to turn by 90 degrees
alex.forward(30)          # Complete the second side of a rectangle

wn.mainloop()             # Wait for user to close window
```

We can speed up or slow down the turtle&#8217;s animation speed. (Animation controls how
quickly the turtle turns and moves forward).  Speed settings can be set
between 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest).  But if we set the speed to 0, it has
a special meaning &#8212; turn off animation and go as fast as possible.

A turtle can &#8220;stamp&#8221; its footprint onto the canvas,
and this will remain after the turtle has moved somewhere else.
Stamping works, even when the pen is up.

Let&#8217;s do an example that shows off some of these new features all together:

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.shape("turtle")
tess.color("blue")

tess.penup()
size = 20
for i in range(30):
    tess.stamp()             # Leave an impression on the canvas
    size = size + 3          # Increase the size on every iteration
    tess.forward(size)       # Move tess along
    tess.right(24)           #  ...  and turn her

wn.mainloop()
```

Be careful now!   How many times was the body of the loop executed?   How many turtle
images do we see on the screen?  All except one of the shapes we see on the screen here
are footprints created by ```stamp```.  But the program still only has *one* turtle
instance &#8212; can you figure out which one here is the real ```tess```?  (Hint: if you&#8217;re not
sure, write a new line of code after the ```for``` loop to change ```tess```&#8216; color,
or to put her pen down and draw a line, or to change her shape, etc.)

## A Turtle Bar Chart

Here are even more new tricks for our turtles:

<ul class="simple">
<li>We can get a turtle to display text on the canvas at the turtle&#8217;s current position.  The method to do that is called ```write```:</li>
</ul>

```
import turtle             # Allows us to use turtles
wn = turtle.Screen()      # Creates a playground for turtles
alex = turtle.Turtle()    # Create a turtle, assign to alex

alex.forward(50)          # Tell alex to move forward by 50 units
alex.left(90)             # Tell alex to turn by 90 degrees
alex.forward(30)          # Complete the second side of a rectangle

alex.write("Hi there!")   # Write a message

wn.mainloop()             # Wait for user to close window
```

<ul class="simple">
<li>We can fill a shape (circle, semicircle, triangle, etc.) with a color.  It is a two-step process.
First we call the method ```alex.begin_fill()```, then we draw the shape, then we call ```alex.end_fill()```.  Below is an example of this using our square example from earlier.</li>
</ul>

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()        # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()      # Create alex

alex.begin_fill()           # Start of the region to fill
for i in range(4):          # Draw the four sides of the square
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)
alex.end_fill()             # Fill the region

wn.mainloop()
```

<ul class="simple">
<li>We&#8217;ve previously set the color of our turtle &#8212; we can now also set its fill color, which need not
be the same as the turtle and the pen color.  We use the ```fillcolor``` method to set the
turtle&#8217;s fill color:</li>
</ul>

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()        # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()      # Create alex
alex.color("blue")          # Set pen color to blue
alex.fillcolor("red")       # Set fill color to red

alex.begin_fill()           # Start of the region to fill
for i in range(4):          # Draw the four sides of the square
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)
alex.end_fill()             # Fill the region

wn.mainloop()
```

Ok, so can we get tess to draw a bar chart?  Let us start with some data to be charted,

```xs = [48, 117, 200, 240, 160, 260, 220]```

Corresponding to each data measurement, we&#8217;ll draw a simple rectangle of that height, with a fixed width.  We&#8217;re showing off a new programming concept called a *function* in the example below: we&#8217;re defining the function ```draw_bar``` to draw a bar of our graph. We&#8217;ll generally want to use a function to encode a complicated task that we&#8217;ll want to repeat many times (like drawing a bar in a bar graph). Don&#8217;t worry too much about the syntax of functions right now &#8212; we&#8217;re going to discuss functions in a lot more detail in the next chapter.

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")

def draw_bar(t, height):
    """ Get turtle t to draw one bar, of height. """
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(height)     # Draw up the left side
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(40)         # Width of bar, along the top
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(height)     # And down again!
    t.left(90)            # Put the turtle facing the way we found it.
    t.forward(10)         # Leave small gap after each bar

xs = [48, 117, 200, 240, 160, 260, 220] # our data
for v in xs:              # Draw a bar for each number in the data
    draw_bar(tess, v)

wn.mainloop()
```

Ok, not fantasically impressive, but it is a nice start!  The important thing here
was the mental chunking, or how we broke the problem into smaller pieces. Our chunk
is to draw one bar, and we wrote a function to do that. Then, for the whole
chart, we repeatedly called our function.

Next, at the top of each bar, we&#8217;ll print the value of the data.
We&#8217;ll do this in the body of ```draw_bar```, by adding   ```t.write('</span>&nbsp; <span class="pre">' + str(height))```
as the new third line of the body.
We&#8217;ve put a little space in front of the number, and turned the
number into a string.  Without this extra space we tend
to cramp our text awkwardly against the bar to the left.
The result looks a lot better now:

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")

def draw_bar(t, height):
    """ Get turtle t to draw one bar, of height. """
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(height)     # Draw up the left side
    t.write("  " + str(height))  # Write the data
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(40)         # Width of bar, along the top
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(height)     # And down again!
    t.left(90)            # Put the turtle facing the way we found it.
    t.forward(10)         # Leave small gap after each bar

xs = [48, 117, 200, 240, 160, 260, 220] # our data
for v in xs:              # Draw a bar for each number in the data
    draw_bar(tess, v)

wn.mainloop()
```

And now we&#8217;ll add code to fill each bar.  Our final program now looks like this:

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")
tess.fillcolor("red")

def draw_bar(t, height):
    """ Get turtle t to draw one bar, of height. """
    t.begin_fill()        # Start of the fill area
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(height)     # Draw up the left side
    t.write("  " + str(height))  # Write the data
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(40)         # Width of bar, along the top
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(height)     # And down again!
    t.left(90)            # Put the turtle facing the way we found it.
    t.end_fill()          # Fill in the bar
    t.forward(10)         # Leave small gap after each bar

xs = [48, 117, 200, 240, 160, 260, 220] # our data
for v in xs:              # Draw a bar for each number in the data
    draw_bar(tess, v)

wn.mainloop()
```


Mmm.  Perhaps the bars should not be joined to each other at the bottom.  We&#8217;ll need to pick up the pen while making the gap between the bars.  We&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise for you!
