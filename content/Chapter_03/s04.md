## The **for** Loop

When we drew the square, it was quite tedious.  We had to explicitly repeat the steps of
moving and turning four times.  If we were drawing a hexagon, an octagon, or an
enneacontaenneagon (that is a polygon with 99 sides!), it would have been worse.

So a basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some
code, over and over again.

Python&#8217;s **for** loop does this.   Let&#8217;s say we have some friends, and
we would like to send them each an email inviting them to our party.  We do not
quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we will just print a message for each friend:


```Python 
for f in ["Joe","Zoe","Brad","Angelina","Zuki","Thandi","Paris"]:
    invite = "Hi " + f + ". Please come to my party on Saturday!"
    print(invite)
# more code can follow here ...
```

The variable ```f``` in the ```for``` statement at line 1 is called the **loop variable**. We could have chosen any other variable name instead.

Lines 2 and 3 are the **loop body**.  The loop body is always
*indented*. The convention is to use 4 spaces of indentation for our loop bodies. The indentation determines exactly what statements are &#8220;in the body of the loop&#8221;.

On each *iteration* or *pass* of the loop, first, a check is done to see if there are
still more items to be processed.  If there are none left (this is called
the **terminating condition** of the loop), the loop has finished.
Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body, (e.g. in this case
the next statement below the comment in line 4).

If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to refer to the
next item in the list.  This means, in this case, that the loop body is executed
here 7 times, and each time ```f``` will refer to a different friend.

At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns
to the ```for``` statement, to see if there are more items to be handled, and to assign the
next one to ```f```.

## Execution of a **for** Loop

As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is
about to be executed.  We call this the **control flow**, of the **flow of execution**
of the program.  When humans execute programs, they often use their finger to point
to each statement in turn.  So we could think of control flow as &#8220;Python&#8217;s moving finger&#8221;.

Control flow until now has been strictly
top to bottom, one statement at a time.  The ```for``` loop changes this.

Control flow is often easy to visualize and understand if we draw a flowchart.
This shows the exact steps and logic of how the ```for``` statement executes.

## Condensing our Turtle Program using Loops

To draw a square we would like to do the same thing four times: move the turtle, and turn left 90 degrees.  
We previously used eight lines to have ```alex``` draw the four sides of a square.

The program below does the same, but using just three lines with a **for** loop:

```Python 
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)

alex = turtle.Turtle() 

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:       # Draw the four sides of the square
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

turtle.mainloop()
```


Some observations:

+ While &#8220;saving some lines of code&#8221; might be convenient, it is not the big deal here.
What is much more important is that we&#8217;ve found a &#8220;repeating pattern&#8221; of statements,
and reorganized our program to repeat the pattern.  Finding the chunks and somehow
getting our programs arranged around those chunks is a vital
skill in computational thinking.

+ The values ```[0, 1, 2, 3]``` were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times.
We could
have used any four values, but these are the conventional ones to use. In fact, getting a list of numbers in order is so useful that Python provides a built-in way to do this using ```range```:


```Python
for i in range(4):
    # Executes the body with i = 0, then 1, then 2, then 3
    print("i = " + str(i))
for i in range(10):
    # Sets i to each of ... [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    print("i = " + str(i))
```

+ Computer scientists like to count from 0 &mdash; this is why ```range(n)``` goes through the numbers from ```0``` up to ```n - 1```.

+ Our little trick earlier to make sure that ```alex``` did the final turn to complete
360 degrees has paid off: if we had not done that, then we would not have been
able to use a loop for the fourth side of the square.
It would have become a &#8220;special case&#8221;,
different from the other sides.  When possible, we&#8217;d much prefer to make
our code fit a general pattern, rather than have to create a special case.
So to repeat something four times, a Python programmer would do this:


```Python
for _ in range(4):	# here, we use _ instead of i since we don't actually need the value
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)
```


By now you should be able to see how to change our previous program so that
```tess``` can also use a ```for``` loop to draw her equilateral triangle.

But now, what would happen if we made the change below? Try to figure out what is going to happen, then run the code to see if you are right!


```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)

alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

for c in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
    alex.color(c)
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

turtle.mainloop()
```

A variable can also be assigned a value that is a list.  So lists can also be used in
more general situations, not only in the ```for``` loop.  The code above could be rewritten like this:

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)

alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

clrs = ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]
for c in clrs:
    alex.color(c)
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)
turtle.mainloop()
```

** Exercise 4.** Change the code above to draw a hexagon.
