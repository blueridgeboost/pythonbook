## A Bale of Turtles

Just like we can have many different integers in a program, we can have many Turtle objects.
Each of them is called an **instance**.  Methods can be called on each instance to change its state and make it move. 

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)
turtle.bgcolor("lightgreen")


tess = turtle.Turtle()       # Create tess and set some attributes
tess.color("hotpink")
tess.pensize(5)

alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex

# Make tess draw an equilateral triangle
tess.forward(80)             
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(80)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(80)
tess.left(120)               # Complete the triangle

tess.right(180)              # Turn tess around
tess.forward(80)             # Move her away from the origin

# Make alex draw a square
alex.forward(50)             
alex.left(90)
alex.forward(50)
alex.left(90)
alex.forward(50)
alex.left(90)
alex.forward(50)
alex.left(90)

turtle.mainloop() 
```

There are 360 degrees in a full circle.  If we add up all the turns that a turtle makes,
*no matter what steps occurred between the turns*, we can easily figure out if they
add up to some multiple of 360. Since ```alex``` has turned ```90 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 360``` degrees, after all the turns he is facing in
the same direction as he was when he was first created. (Geometry
conventions have 0 degrees facing to the right, and that is the case here too!)

We could have left out the last turn for ```alex```, but if we are asked to draw a closed shape like a square or a rectangle, it is a good idea to
complete all the turns and to leave the turtle back where it started, facing the
same direction as it started in.
This makes reasoning about the program and composing chunks of code into bigger programs
easier.

We did the same with ```tess```: she drew her triangle and turned through a full 360 degrees.
Then we turned her around and moved her aside.  

Blank lines are used to separate groups of movements by shape. The movements for 
```tess``` were &#8220;draw the triangle&#8221;
(lines 12-17) and then &#8220;move away from the origin&#8221; (lines 19 and 20).</li>

One of the key uses for comments is to record our mental chunking, and big ideas.
They&#8217;re not always explicit in the code.</li>

Two turtles may not be enough for a herd. But the important idea is
that the turtle module gives us a kind of factory that lets us create
as many turtles as we need. Each instance has its own state and
behavior.

**Exercise 3.** Turtles all the way down!

Now that you know how to move and change the properties of turtles, you can make interesting drawings.

The code below starts a drawing. Modify and complete the drawing to make something more interesting! You can create as many Turtle objects as you want.

Suggestions:
1. Change the background color.
2. Make ```raphael``` draw a hexagon.
3. Create a new ```Turtle``` object, set the color and the pen size. Use it to draw a shape of your choosing.

```
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen()
turtle.setup(200,200)

turtle.colormode(255)       #  r, g, b values of color triples have to be in the range 0..255. 
turtle.bgcolor(255, 0, 255) # ("lightgreen")

leonardo = turtle.Turtle()       # Create Leonardo, a skilled turtle leader
leonardo.color("darkgreen")
leonardo.pensize(5)

raphael = turtle.Turtle()       # Create Raphael, a strong turtle
raphael.color("red")
raphael.pensize(3)

donatello = turtle.Turtle()      # Create Donatello, the smartest turtle
donatello.color("purple")
donatello.pensize(3)

leonardo.forward(80)             # Make leonardo draw an equilateral triangle
leonardo.left(120)
leonardo.forward(80)
leonardo.left(120)
leonardo.forward(80)
leonardo.left(120)               # Complete the triangle

leonardo.right(180)              # Turn leonardo around
leonardo.forward(80)             # Move her away from the origin

raphael.forward(50)              # Make raphael draw a square
raphael.left(90)
raphael.forward(50)
raphael.left(90)
raphael.forward(50)
raphael.left(90)
raphael.forward(50)
raphael.left(90)

turtle.mainloop()
```
