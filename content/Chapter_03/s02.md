An object can have various methods &#8212; things it can do &#8212;
and it can also have **attributes** (sometimes called
*properties*). These are internal variables that can be used to
keep track of the state of the object.

For the Turtle objects, we can't manipulate the internal state directly but instead 
can invoke methods on a Turtle object to change
its internal state. We've already seen this with the facing direction
in the last part &mdash; something must be keeping track of the
direction the Turtle object is facing since it moves in a different
forward direction after we called ```shelly.left(90)```.

The color of the turtle, the width of its pen, the position of the
turtle within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its
current **state**.   Similarly, the window has a background color.

The example below produces a nicer drawing by using the ```color``` and ```pensize``` methods to change the state of the Turtle object, and the ```bgcolor``` method to change the state of the canvas.

```Python
import turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)

turtle.bgcolor("lightgreen")    # Set the background color

shelly = turtle.Turtle()
shelly.color("blue")		    # Tell shelly to change her color
shelly.pensize(3)               # Tell shelly to set her pen width

shelly.forward(50)
shelly.left(120)
shelly.forward(50)
turtle.mainloop() 
```

Running the program produces the output below. Notice the changes in the size of the drawing area, the color of the background and lines, and the thickness of the lines.

**Exercise 2.** Add code to the program from the first section to set the background color and the pen color. Use both ways described below.

To change the color of the turtle we use the method ```color```. This method takes an input that describes a color. There are a few different ways to describe a color in Python.

1. ```color(colorstring)```  
The simplest way to describe a color is to just use a name like ```"red"``` or ```"blue"```. Note that the color name is a Python string, so needs to be surrounded by quotes. This works for common color names, and even some unusual ones like ```"RebeccaPurple"```! But, it has to be a name of a color that is defined in Python (if you want to see a list of available color names, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors).

2. ```color(r, g, b)```  
Those aren't all the colors you can make though - you can also create your own colors by passing in three numbers giving the red, green, and blue levels of the color. There are some different ways to do this, but the simplest is to use a number from ```0``` to ```255``` for each color channel. So, the color, ```color(255, 0, 255)``` would be full red, no green, and full blue.

The method ```bgcolor``` is similar, but it changes the color of the canvas background. Note that we call this method on the ```turtle``` module, not on a Turtle object.
