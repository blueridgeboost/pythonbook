An object can have various methods &#8212; things it can do &#8212;
and it can also have **attributes** (sometimes called
*properties*). These are like internal variables that can be used to
keep track of the state of the object.

For the Turtle objects, we can't manipulate the internal state
directly, but instead can invoke methods on a Turtle object to change
its internal state. We've already seen this with the facing direction
in the last part &mdash; something must be keeping track of the
direction the Turtle object is facing since it moves in a different
forward direction after we called ```shelly.left(90)```.

The color of the turtle, the width of its pen, the position of the
turtle within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its
current **state**.   Similarly, the window has a background color.

The example below produces a nicer drawing by using the ```color``` and ```pensize``` methods to change the state of the Turtle object, and the ```bgcolor``` method to change the state of the canvas.

```Python
import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)

turtle.bgcolor("lightgreen")    # Set the background color

shelly = turtle.Turtle()
shelly.color("blue")		# Tell shelly to change her color
shelly.pensize(3)               # Tell shelly to set her pen width

shelly.forward(50)
shelly.left(120)
shelly.forward(50)
```

Running the program produces the output below. Notice the chages in the size of the drawing area, color of the background and lines, and the thickness of the lines.
