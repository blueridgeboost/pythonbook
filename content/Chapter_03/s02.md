An object can have various methods &#8212; things it can do &#8212; and it can also have
**attributes** (sometimes called *properties*).  For example, each turtle has
a *color* attribute.  The method invocation
```alex.color("red")``` will make ```alex``` red, and drawing will be red too.

The color of the turtle, the width of its pen, the position of the
turtle within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its
current **state**.   Similarly, the window has a background color.

From the several methods that allow us to modify the turtle and the
window we will show only a couple in the program below. 

```
import ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle as turtle

turtle.clearscreen() 
turtle.setup(200,200)

turtle.bgcolor("lightgreen")      # Set the background color

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")            # Tell tess to change her color
tess.pensize(3)               # Tell tess to set her pen width

tess.forward(50)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(50)
```

Running the program produces the output below. Notice the chages in the size of the drawing area, color of the background and lines, and the thickness of the lines.
