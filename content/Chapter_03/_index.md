### Using Libraries

In Chapter 2, you learned a few data types that are part of the Python language. 
With these types and other language constructs, programmers can build their own 
datatypes and share them with other language users. These data types are 
packaged in libraries and the logical unit that contains the code is called a 
*modules*.

In this chapter, you will learn how to use the ```turtle``` module to create turtles and use them
to draw shapes and patterns. This chapter is also a brief overview of several important coding concepts
that will be explored in depth in later chapters.

[The Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) contains an exhaustive description of the library.
