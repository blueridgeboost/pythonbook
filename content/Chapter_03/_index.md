### A first library use

There are many *modules* in Python that provide very powerful features that we
can use in our own programs.  Some of these can send email, or fetch web pages.
The one use at in this chapter allows us to create turtles and use them
to draw shapes and patterns.

The turtles are fun, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves
a little more Python, and to develop our theme of *computational thinking*,
or *thinking like a computer scientist*.  Most of the Python covered here
will be explored in more depth later.
