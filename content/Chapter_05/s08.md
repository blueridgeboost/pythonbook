The following function counts the number of decimal digits in a positive
integer:

```
def num_digits(n):
    count = 0
    while n != 0:
        count = count + 1
        n = n // 10
    return count

print(num_digits(731))
```

Trace the execution of this function call to convince yourself that it works.

This function demonstrates an important pattern of computation called a **counter**.
The variable ```count``` is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time the
loop body is executed. When the loop exits, ```count``` contains the result,
the total number of times the loop body was executed, which is the same as the
number of digits.

A common mistake is to forget to initialize your counter before you start your loop. You will get a runtime error if you do that, like in the example below:

```
def num_digits(n):
    while n != 0:
        count = count + 1
        n = n // 10
    return count
```

If we wanted to only count digits that are either 0 or 5, adding a conditional
before incrementing the counter will do the trick:

```
def num_zero_and_five_digits(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        if digit == 0 or digit == 5:
            count = count + 1
        n = n // 10
    return count

print(num_zero_and_five_digits(1055030250))</textarea>
```

Confirm that ```num_zero_and_five_digits(1055030250)``` returns ```7```.

Notice, however, that ```num_digits(0)``` appears to fail.  Explain why.  Do you think this is a bug in
the code, or a bug in the specifications, or our expectations, or the tests?
