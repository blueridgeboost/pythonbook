### Loops and iterations

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or
similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and
people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a set of statements is called **iteration**.  Because

easier. We&#8217;ve already seen the ```for``` statement: this the
the form of iteration you&#8217;ll likely be using most often.  But in this chapter
