### Loops and iterations

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or
similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and
people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a set of statements is called **iteration**.  Because
iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it
easier. We have already seen the ```for``` statement: this the
the form of iteration you will likely be using most often.  
In this chapter, we will learn the ```while``` statement: another way to have your
program do iteration, useful in slightly different circumstances.

Before we do that, we will review a few ideas...
