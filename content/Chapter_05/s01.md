As we have mentioned previously, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the
same variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value
(and stop referring to the old value).

```
airtime_remaining = 15
print(airtime_remaining)
airtime_remaining = 7
print(airtime_remaining)
```

The first time ```airtime_remaining``` is
printed, its value is 15, and the second time, its value is 7.

It is especially important to distinguish between an
assignment statement and a Boolean expression that tests for equality.
Because Python uses the equal token (```=```) for assignment,
it is tempting to interpret a statement like
```a = b``` as a Boolean test.  Unlike mathematics, it is not!  Remember that the Python token
for the equality operator is ```==```.

Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but the assignment is not. For example,
if ```a == 7``` then ```7 == a```. But in Python, the statement ```a = 7```
is legal and ```7 =  a``` is not.

In Python, an assignment statement can make
two variables equal, but because further assignments can change either of them,
they do not have to stay that way:

```
a = 5
b = a    # After executing this line, a and b are now equal
print("a="+str(a)+" b="+str(b))
a = 3    # After executing this line, a and b are no longer equal
print("a="+str(a)+" b="+str(b))
```

Line 4 changes the value of ```a``` but does not change the value of
```b```, so they are no longer equal.
