## The ```break``` statement

The **break** statement is used to immediately leave the body of its loop.  The next
statement to be executed is the first one after the body:

```
for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29]:
    if i % 2 == 1:  # If the number is odd
        break        #  ... immediately exit the loop
    print(i)
print("done")
```

## The ```continue``` statement

This is a control flow statement that causes the program to immediately skip the
processing of the rest of the body of the loop, *for the current iteration*.  But
the loop still carries on running for its remaining iterations:

```
for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29, 30]:
    if i % 2 == 1:      # If the number is odd
        continue         # Don't process it
    print(i)
print("done")
```
