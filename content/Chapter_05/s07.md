To write effective computer programs, and to build a good conceptual
model of program execution, a programmer needs to develop the ability
to **trace** the execution of a computer program. Tracing involves becoming the
computer and following the flow of execution through a sample program run,
recording the state of all variables and any output the program generates after
each instruction is executed.

To understand this process, we will trace the call to ```seq_3n_plus_1``` from a
previous section. At the start of the trace, we have a variable, ```n```
(the parameter), with an initial value of 3. Since 3 is not equal to 1, the
```while``` loop body is executed. 3 is printed and ```3 % 2 == 0``` is evaluated.
Since it evaluates to ```False```, the ```else``` branch is executed and
```3 * 3 + 1``` is evaluated and assigned to ```n```.

To keep track of all this as you hand trace a program, make a column heading on
a piece of paper for each variable created as the program runs and another one
for output. Our trace so far would look something like this:


<div><div class="highlight-pycon"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">n               output printed so far</span>
<span class="go">--              ---------------------</span>
<span class="go">3               3,</span>
<span class="go">10</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

Since ```10 != 1``` evaluates to ```True```, the loop body is again executed,
and 10 is printed. ```10 % 2 == 0``` is true, so the ```if``` branch is
executed and ```n``` becomes 5. By the end of the trace we have:


<div><div class="highlight-pycon"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">n               output printed so far</span>
<span class="go">--              ---------------------</span>
<span class="go">3               3,</span>
<span class="go">10              3, 10,</span>
<span class="go">5               3, 10, 5,</span>
<span class="go">16              3, 10, 5, 16,</span>
<span class="go">8               3, 10, 5, 16, 8,</span>
<span class="go">4               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4,</span>
<span class="go">2               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,</span>
<span class="go">1               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
Tracing can be a bit tedious and error-prone (that is why we get computers to do
this stuff in the first place!), but it is an essential skill for a programmer
to have.
