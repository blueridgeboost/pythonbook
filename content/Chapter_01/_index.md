### Chapter 1

# The way of program

The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. As
computer scientists, we will combine some of the best features of mathematics,
engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, we will use formal
languages to communicate our ideas. Like engineers, we will design complex
systems, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs
among alternatives.  Like scientists, we will observe the behavior of complex
systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is **problem
solving**. Problem solving is a skill that involves formulating problems, thinking
creatively about solutions, and expressing a solution clearly and accurately. As
it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
practice problem-solving skills. That&#8217;s why this chapter is called *The way of
the program*.
