The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example
of a **high-level language**; other high-level languages you might have heard
of are C++, PHP, Pascal, C#, and Java.

As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also
**low-level languages**, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly
languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in
low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be
translated into something more suitable before they can run.

Almost all programs are written in high-level languages because of their advantages.
It is much easier to program in a
high-level language so programs take less time
to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be
correct. Second, high-level languages are **portable**, meaning that they can
run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications.

The engine that translates and runs Python is called the **Python Interpreter**:
There are two ways to use it: *immediate mode* and *script
mode*. In immediate mode, which we also call *shell mode*, you type Python expressions
into the Python interpreter window (which is also called the **shell**),
and the interpreter immediately shows the result.

In AoPS classes, we will use the IDLE application that comes built-in with most Python
installations. In IDLE, the Python interpreter window is labeled **Python Shell**.

Instructions for installing Python on your computer are including in the *Course Introduction* document
on the AoPS class homepage, and are also posted on the class message board. When you start up
IDLE on your computer, it should look something like this:

The ```>>``` is called the **Python prompt**. The interpreter uses the prompt to indicate that it is ready for instructions. 
We typed ```2+2```, and the interpreter evaluated our expression, and replied ```4```,
and on the next line it gave a new prompt, indicating that it is ready for more.

Alternatively, you can write a program in a file and use the interpreter to
run the lines of code in the file. Such a file is called a **script**.  Scripts have the advantage
that they can be saved, printed, and so on. A Python script is often called a **module**.

For example, we can created a file named ```firstprogram.py``` using IDLE.
By convention, files that contain Python programs have names that end with
```.py```. To do this, select &#8220;New File&#8221; or &#8220;New Window&#8221; from the File menu of IDLE, and then type
the following two lines into the new window that appears:

To run the program, we can select the &#8220;Run Module&#8221; or &#8220;Run Program&#8221; option from the &#8220;Run&#8221; menu of IDLE (or
alternatively you can press the F5 key). IDLE will ask you to save your program before it
can run it. Save it using the name ```firstprogram.py```. Then your program will run, and it
should look something like the screenshot below:

Notice that the program always runs in the Shell window.

Don&#8217;t worry, most programs are more interesting than this one.

Working directly in the interpreter is convenient for testing short bits of code because you
get immediate feedback. Think of it as scratch paper used to help you work out
problems. Anything longer than a few lines should be put into a script.

There&#8217;s a third way that you can run Python using this ebook. In many places in this ebook,
we&#8217;ll have a Python interpreter built directly into the text. For example, our program
from above can appear directly in the book as shown below:

```
print('My first program adds two numbers.')
print(2+3)
```


If you click the &#8220;Run&#8221; button, the program will run and you&#8217;ll see its output above directly in the ebook.
You can also edit the code directly in the window above. If you click the &#8220;Reset&#8221; button (or refresh
your browser window), the code will return to what it originally was (that is, any edits that you&#8217;ve
made will be removed.) The little numbers to the left are **line numbers**, and you don&#8217;t
type them in. They appear automatically in our ebook, so that it&#8217;s easier for us to discuss our
program. For example, we can say &#8220;line 1 of our program prints a sentence&#8221;.
