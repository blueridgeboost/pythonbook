Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct;
otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message.  **Syntax** refers
to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example,
in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
this sentence contains a **syntax error**. So does this one

For most humans, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is
why we can read the above sentences and still figure out what they mean.
Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your
program, Python will display an error message and quit, and you will not be able
to run your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you
will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain
experience, though, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.
