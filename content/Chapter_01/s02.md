A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a
computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a
system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a
symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions
appear in just about every language:

- input. Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
- output. Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
- math. Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
- conditional execution. Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of
statements.
- repetition. Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Believe it or not, that&#8217;s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you&#8217;ve
ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more
or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as the process of
breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the
subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic
instructions.

That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic later when we
talk about **algorithms**.
