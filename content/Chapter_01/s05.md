The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does
not appear until you run the program. These errors are also called
**exceptions** because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and
bad) has happened.

Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few
chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.
