As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read.
Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of
code and figure out what it is doing, or why.

For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in
natural language what the program is doing.

A **comment** in a computer program is text that is intended
only for the human reader &#8212; it is completely ignored by the interpreter.

In Python, the <cite>#</cite> token starts a comment.  The rest of the line
is ignored.   Here is a new version of *Hello, World!*.

```
#---------------------------------------------------
# This demo program shows off how elegant Python is!
# Written by Joe Soap, December 2010.
# Anyone may freely copy or modify this program.
#---------------------------------------------------

print("Hello, World!")     # Isn't this easy!

```

You&#8217;ll also notice that we&#8217;ve left a blank line in the program.  Blank lines
are also ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your
programs much easier for humans to parse.  Use them!
