Programming is a complex process, and because it is done by human beings, it
often leads to errors. Programming errors are called
**bugs** and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called
**debugging**.  Use of the term *bug* to describe small engineering difficulties
dates back to at least 1889, when Thomas Edison had a bug with his phonograph.

Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: **syntax errors**, **runtime errors**,
and **semantic errors**.  It is useful to
distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.
