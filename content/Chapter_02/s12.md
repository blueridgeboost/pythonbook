Use the Python Interpreter to answer the questions.

**Question 1**. Take the sentence: *Every cloud has a silver lining.*

Store each word in a separate variable, then print out the sentence on *one* line using six print statements.

Note: You will have to add a second argument to change the end from new line to empty string.

```print("Hello, world!", end="")```

**Question 2.** Write a *single* string containing two sentences. Use the
escape character ```'\n'``` to separate the sentences.

Print the string. What do you observe?

**Question 3**. What type do you think the following expressions have?
```1.0 + 1```
```'3.14'```
```4//2```
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

**Question 4.** Define a variable ```x``` and initialize it to the value of the expression ```6 * 1 - 2```.

Add parenthesis to the expression ```6 * 1 - 2``` to change its value from ```4``` to ```-6```. Initialize a variable ```y``` with the new expression.

Print both variables.

**Question 5.** If we run the code below, the Python interpreter reports an error. Explain the error in your own words.

```
z + 4
print(z)
```

**Question 6**. Fix the error so that the output of the program is ```8```.

```
# Fix the error
z + 4
print(z)
```

**Question 7**. Use the ```*``` to print the word *blah* ten times.

**Question 8**. Would you rather have a penny that doubles each day for a month or one million dollars?

Write a Python program to solve the riddle.

Note: use the exponential operator ```**```.

**Question 9.** If your grandparents deposited $100 the day you are born in an account earning 5% per year interest compounded quarterly.

where
- ```P``` is the initial investment
- ```r``` is the yearly interest rate
- ```n``` is the number of times the interest is compounded per year
- ```t``` is the number of years.

*Hints.*

1. Create a variable for each quantity given in the problem: ```P```, ```r```, ```n```.

2.  Define a variable that holds your current age.

3. Use the variables above to initialize a new variable with how much money you would have had in your account on your last birthday.

4. Print the last variable.

**Question 10**. Evaluate mentally the following numerical expressions. Record your answers below.

```5 % 2```

```9 % 5```

```15 % 12```

```12 % 15```

```6 % 6```

```0 % 7```

```7 % 0```

**Question 11**. Use the Python interpreter to check your results.


**Question 12**. What happened with the last example? Why? If you were able to correctly anticipate the computerâ€™s response in all but the last one, it is time to move on. If not, take time now to make up examples of your own. Explore the modulus operator until you are confident you understand how it works.

**Question 13**. Write a Python program that calculates the time 1000 hours from now.
