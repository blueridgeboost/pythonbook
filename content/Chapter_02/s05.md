An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. If you
type an expression at the Python prompt, the interpreter **evaluates** it and
displays the result:

```
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> len("hello")
5
```
In this example, ```len``` is a built-in Python function that returns the number of characters in a string.
We have previously seen the ```print``` and the ```type``` functions, so this is our third example of a function!

The *evaluation of an expression* produces a value, which is why expressions
can appear on the right-hand side of assignment statements. A value all by
itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable.

```
>>> 17
17
>>> y = 3.14
>>> x = len("hello")
>>> x
5
>>> y
3.14
```
