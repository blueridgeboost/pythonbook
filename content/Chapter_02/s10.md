There is a built-in function in Python for getting input from the user:

```
n = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hi, " + n)
```


When you run this script, the program pauses to receive user input.
The user of the program can enter the name, and when this happens
the text that has been entered is assigned to the variable ```n```.
This variable is then printed by the ```print``` function in line 2.

Even if you asked the user to enter their age, you would get back a string like ```"17"```.
It would be your job, as the programmer, to convert that string into an int or a float,
using the ```int``` or ```float``` converter functions we saw earlier.
