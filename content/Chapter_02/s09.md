In general, you cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the
strings look like numbers. The following are illegal (assuming that ```message```
has type string):


```
>>> message - 1        # Error
>>> "Hello" / 123      # Error
>>> message * "Hello"  # Error
>>> "15" + 2           # Error
```

Interestingly, the ```+``` operator does work with strings, but for strings,
the ```+``` operator represents **concatenation**, not addition.
Concatenation means joining the two operands by linking them end-to-end. For example:


```
fruit = "banana"
baked_good = " nut bread"
print(fruit + baked_good)
```

The output of this program is ```banana nut bread```. The space before the word
```nut``` is part of the string, and is necessary to produce the space between
the concatenated strings.

The ```*``` operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example:

```
print('Fun' * 3)
```

One of the operands has to be a string; the other has to be an integer.

On one hand, this interpretation of ```+``` and ```*``` makes sense by analogy with
addition and multiplication. Just as ```4*3``` is equivalent to ```4+4+4```, we
expect ```"Fun"*3``` to be the same as ```"Fun"+"Fun"+"Fun"```, and it is.
