One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to
manipulate **variables**. A variable is a name that refers to a value, more precisely 
to a memory location in the computer's memory where a value is stored.

The **assignment statement** gives a value to a variable:

```
>>> message = "What's up, Doc?"
>>> n = 17
>>> pi = 3.14159
```

This example makes three assignments. The first assigns the string value ```"What's up, Doc?"``` to a variable named ```message```. The second gives the integer
```17``` to ```n```, and the third assigns the floating-point number ```3.14159``` to
a variable called ```pi```.

The **assignment operator**, ```=```, should not be confused with *equals*, which uses
the token ```==```.  The assignment statement assigns a *value*, on the
right-hand side of the operator, to a *name*, on the left-hand side.
This is why you will get an error if you enter:

```
>>> 17 = n
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
```

Tip. When reading or writing code, say to yourself "n is assigned 17"
or "n gets the value 17".  Do not say "n equals 17".

A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow
pointing to the variable's value. This kind of figure is called a **state
snapshot** because it shows what state each of the variables is in at a particular
instant in time.  
This diagram shows the result of executing the assignment statements:

If you ask the interpreter to evaluate a variable, it will produce the value that is currently
linked to the variable:

```
>>> message
'What's up, Doc?'
>>> n
17
>>> pi
3.14159
```

We use variables in a program to "remember" things, perhaps the current score at the football game.
But variables are *variable*. This means they can change over time, just like the scoreboard at a football game.
You can assign a value to a variable, and later assign a different value to the same variable.
(*This is different from math. In math, if you give `x` the value 3, it
cannot change to link to a _different value _halfway_ through your_ calculations!*)

```
>>> day = "Thursday"
>>> day
'Thursday'
>>> day = "Friday"
>>> day
'Friday'
>>> day = 21
>>> day
21
```

You will notice we changed the value of ```day``` three times, and on the third assignment, we even
made it refer to a value that was of a different type.

A great deal of programming is about having the computer remember things, for example, _the number_ of missed calls on your phone*,
and then arranging to update or change the variable when you miss another call.
