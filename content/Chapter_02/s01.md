A **value** is one of the fundamental things &#8212; like a letter or a number &#8212; that a program manipulates. 
Some of the values we have seen so far are ```5``` (the
result when we added ```2+3```), and ```Hello World!```.

These values are classified into different **classes**, or **data types**: ```5```
is an *integer*, and ```"Hello, World!"``` is a *string*,
so-called because it contains a string of
letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are
enclosed in quotation marks.

If you are not sure what class a value falls into, Python has a function
called **type** which can tell you, as in the example below. (Anytime we show you an
example with lines that start with ```>>>```, these are examples that you can try in
the IDLE shell.)

```
>>> type("Hello, World!")
<class 'str'>
>>> type(17)
<class 'int'>
```

Not surprisingly, strings belong to the class **str** and integers belong to the
class **int**. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a class
called **float**, because these numbers are represented in a format called
*floating-point*.  At this stage, you can treat the words *class* and *type*
interchangeably.  

```
>>> type(3.2)
<class 'float'>
```

What about values like ```"17"``` and ```"3.2"```? They look like numbers, but they
are in quotation marks like strings.

```
>>> type("17")
<class "str">
>>> type(";3.2";)
<class "str">
```

They&#8217;re strings!

Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (```'```) or double quotes
(```"```), or three of each (```'''``` or ```"""```)</p>
```
>>> type('This is a string.')
<class "str">
>>> type("And so is this.")
<class "str">
>>> type('''and this.''')
<class "str">
>>> type("""and even this...""")
<class "str">
```

Double quoted strings can contain single quotes inside them, as in
```"Bruce's beard"```, and single quoted strings can have double quotes
inside them, as in ```'The knights who say "Ni!"'```.
Strings enclosed with three occurrences of either quote symbol are
called triple quoted strings.  They can
contain either single or double quotes:
```
>>> print(""""Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"""")
"Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"
```

Triple quoted strings can even span multiple lines:
```
>>> message = """This message will
... span several
... lines."""
>>> print(message)
This message will
span several
lines.
```

Python doesn&#8217;t care whether you use single or double quotes or
the three-of-a-kind quotes to surround your strings:
once it has parsed the text of your program or command, the way it stores the
value is identical in all cases, and the surrounding quotes are not part of
the value. But when the interpreter wants to display a string, it has to
decide which quotes to use to make it look like a string.

```
>>> "This is a string."
"This is a string."
>>> """And so is this."""
"And so is this."
```

So the Python language designers usually chose to surround their strings
by single quotes.  What do think would happen if the string already
contained single quotes?

When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between
groups of three digits, as in ```42,000```. This is not a legal integer in
Python, but it does mean something else, which is legal:

```
>>> 42000
42000
>>> 42,000
(42, 0)
```

Well, that&#8217;s not what we expected at all! Because of the comma, Python chose to
treat this as a *pair* of values.  We&#8217;ll come back to learn about pairs later.
But, for the moment, remember not to put commas or spaces in your integers, no matter
how big they are. Also revisit what we said in the previous chapter: formal languages are
strict, the notation is concise, and even the smallest change might
mean something quite different from what you intended.
