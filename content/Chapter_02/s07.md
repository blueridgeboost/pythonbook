Sometimes we need to convert values from one type to another. The Python interpreter provides several functions, called
**type converter** functions. These include ```int```, ```float``` and ```str```, which will (attempt to)
convert their arguments into types ```int```, ```float``` and ```str``` respectively. 

The ```int``` function can take a floating point number or a string, and turn
it into an int. For floating point numbers, it *discards* the decimal portion
of the number,  a process called *truncation towards zero* on
the number line.  Let us see this in action:


```
>>> int(3.14)
3
>>> int(3.9999)             # This doesn't round to the closest int!
3
>>> int(3.0)
3
>>> int(-3.999)             # Note that the result is closer to zero
-3
>>> int(minutes / 60)
10
>>> int("2345")             # Parse a string to produce an int
2345
>>> int(17)                 # It even works if arg is already an int
17
>>> int("23 bottles")
```

This last case does not look like a number. The output is shown below. 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;pyshell#4>", line 1, in &lt;module>
        int("23 bottles")
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '23 bottles'
```

The type converter ```float``` can turn an integer, a float, or a syntactically legal
string into a float:


```
>>> float(17)
17.0
>>> float("123.45")
123.45
```

The type converter ```str``` turns its argument into a string:


```
>>> str(17)
'17'
>>> str(123.45)
'123.45'
```
