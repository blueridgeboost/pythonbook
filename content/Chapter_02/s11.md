So far, we have looked at the elements of a program: variables, expressions,
statements, and function calls, in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to
take small building blocks and **compose** them into larger chunks.

For example, we know how to get the user to enter some input, we know how to
convert the string we get into a float, we know how to write a complex expression, and
we know how to print values. Let's put these together in a small four-step program that
asks the user to input a value for the radius of a circle, and then
computes the area of the circle from the formula

Area = pi * r^2

```
response = input("What is your radius? ")
r = float(response)
area = 3.14159 * r**2
print("The area is " + str(area))
```

Notice that we have to convert the value of the variable ```area``` to a string before we can print it. If we do not, we get an error:


```
response = input("What is your radius? ")
r = float(response)
area = 3.14159 * r**2
print("The area is " + area)
```

We get a runtime error in the above program because Python does not know how to *add* a string and a float. We need to convert the float to a string before we can add (that is, concatenate) it to the string ```"The area is "```.

Typically, experienced programmers compose the first two lines into a single line of code.

```
r = float( input("What is your radius? ") )
area = 3.14159 * r**2
print("The area is " + area)
```

Combining all statements into a single one is possible, but not a good idea.

```
print("The area is " + str(3.14159 * float(input("What is your radius? "))**2))
```

Such compact code may not be most understandable for humans, but it does
illustrate how we can compose bigger chunks from our building blocks.
