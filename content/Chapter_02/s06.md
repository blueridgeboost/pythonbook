**Operators** are special tokens that represent computations like addition,
multiplication and division. The values the operator uses are called **operands**.

The following are all legal Python expressions whose meaning is more or less
clear:

```
20+32   hour-1   hour*60+minute   minute/60   5**2   (5+9)*(15-7)
```

The tokens ```+```, ```-```, and ```*```, and the use of parenthesis for grouping,
mean in Python what they mean in mathematics. The asterisk (```*```) is the
token for multiplication, and ```**``` is the token for exponentiation.

```
>>> 2 ** 3
8
>>> 3 ** 2
9
```

When a variable name appears in the place of an operand, it is replaced with
its value before the operation is performed.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation all do what you
expect.

Example: so let us convert 645 minutes into hours:

```
>>> minutes = 645
>>> hours = minutes / 60
>>> hours
10.75
```

Oops! In Python 3, the division operator ```/``` always yields a floating point result.
What we might have wanted to know was how many *whole* hours there are, and how many minutes remain.
Python gives us two different flavors of the division operator.
The second, called **floor division** uses the token <cite>//</cite>.
Its result is always a whole number &#8212; and if it has to adjust the number it always
moves it to the left on the number line.  So ```6 // 4``` yields ```1```, but ```-6 // 4``` might surprise you!

```
>>> 7 / 4
1.75
>>> 7 // 4
1
>>> minutes = 645
>>> hours = minutes // 60
>>> hours
10
```

Take care that you choose the correct flavor of the division operator.  If you&#8217;re
working with expressions where you need floating point values, use the division operator
that does the division accurately.
