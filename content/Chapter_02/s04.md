A **statement** is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We
have only seen the assignment statement so far.  Some other kinds of statements that
we&#8217;ll see shortly are ```while``` statements, ```for``` statements, ```if``` statements,
and ```import``` statements.  (There are other kinds too!)

When you type a statement on the command line, Python executes it.  Statements
don&#8217;t produce any result.
