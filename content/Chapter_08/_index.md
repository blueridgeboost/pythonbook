So far we have seen built-in types like ``int``, ``float``, 
``bool``, ``str`` and we've seen lists and pairs. 
Strings, lists, and pairs are qualitatively different from the others because they
are made up of smaller pieces.  In the case of strings, they're made up of smaller
strings each containing one **character**.  

Types that comprise smaller pieces are called **compound data types**.
Depending on what we are doing, we may want to treat a compound data type as a
single thing, or we may want to access its parts. This ambiguity is useful.
