## The built-in ``find`` method
 
Now that we've done all this work to write a powerful ``find`` function, we can reveal that
strings already have their own built-in ``find`` method.  It can do everything 
that our code can do, and more!  

```
test(ss.find("s") == 7)
test(ss.find("s", 7) == 7)
test(ss.find("s", 8) == 13)
test(ss.find("s", 8, 13) == -1)
test(ss.find(".") == len(ss)-1)
```
     
The built-in ``find`` method is more general than our version. It can find
substrings, not just single characters:
```    
>>> "banana".find("nan")
2
>>> "banana".find("na", 3)
4
```

Usually, we would prefer to use the methods that Python provides rather than reinvent
our own equivalents. But many of the built-in functions and methods make good
teaching exercises, and the underlying techniques you learn are your building blocks
to becoming a proficient programmer.

## The ``split`` method

One of the most useful methods on strings is the ``split`` method:
it splits a single multi-word string into a list of individual words, removing
all the whitespace between them.  (Whitespace means any tabs, newlines, or spaces.)
This allows us to read input as a single string,
and split it into words.

```        
>>> ss = "Well I never did said Alice" 
>>> wds = ss.split()
>>> wds
['Well', 'I', 'never', 'did', 'said', 'Alice']
```

## The string format method 
 
The easiest and most powerful way to format a string in Python 3 is to use the
``format`` method.  To see how this works, let's start with a few examples:

```
s1 = "His name is {0}!".format("Arthur")
print(s1)

name = "Alice"
age = 10
s2 = "I am {1} and I am {0} years old.".format(age, name)
print(s2)

n1 = 4
n2 = 5
s3 = "2**10 = {0} and {1} * {2} = {3:f}".format(2**10, n1, n2, n1 * n2)
print(s3)
```
    
Running the script produces: 

```
His name is Arthur!
I am Alice and I am 10 years old.
        2**10 = 1024 and 4 * 5 = 20.000000
```

The template string contains *place holders*,  ``... {0} ... {1} ... {2} ...`` etc.   
The ``format`` method substitutes its arguments into the place holders.
The numbers in the place holders are indexes that determine which argument
gets substituted --- make sure you understand line 6 above! 

But there's more!  Each of the replacement fields can also contain a **format specification** ---
it is always introduced by the ``:`` symbol  (Line 11 above uses one.)  
This modifies how the substitutions are made into the template, and can control things like:

* whether the field is aligned to the left ``<``, center ``^``, or right ``>``
* the width allocated to the field within the result string (a number like ``10``)
* the type of conversion (we'll initially only force conversion to float, ``f``, as we did in
  line 11 of the code above, or perhaps we'll ask integer numbers to be converted to hexadecimal using ``x``)
* if the type conversion is a float, you can also specify how many decimal places are wanted 
  (typically, ``.2f`` is useful for working with currencies to two decimal places.)

Let's do a few simple and common examples that should be enough for most needs.  If you need to
do anything more esoteric, use *help* and read all the powerful, gory details.

```
n1 = "Paris"
n2 = "Whitney"
n3 = "Hilton"

print("Pi to three decimal places is {0:.3f}".format(3.1415926))
print("123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789")
print("|||{0:<15}|||{1:^15}|||{2:>15}|||Born in {3}|||" 
                .format(n1,n2,n3,1981))
print("The decimal value {0} converts to hex value {0:x}"
                .format(123456))
```

This script produces the output: 
```
Pi to three decimal places is 3.142
123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
|||Paris          |||    Whitney    |||         Hilton|||Born in 1981|||
The decimal value 123456 converts to hex value 1e240
```

You can have multiple placeholders indexing the
same argument, or perhaps even have extra arguments that are not referenced
at all:

```
letter = """
        Dear {0} {2}.
         {0}, I have an interesting money-making proposition for you!
         If you deposit $10 million into my bank account, I can 
         double your money ...
        """

print(letter.format("Paris", "Whitney", "Hilton"))
print(letter.format("Bill", "Henry", "Gates"))
```
    
This produces the following:
```
Dear Paris Hilton.
 Paris, I have an interesting money-making proposition for you!
 If you deposit $10 million into my bank account, I can
 double your money ...     
         
Dear Bill Gates.
 Bill, I have an interesting money-making proposition for you!
 If you deposit $10 million into my bank account I can
 double your money ...
```

As you might expect, you'll get an index error if 
your placeholders refer to arguments that you do not provide: 
```
>>> "hello {3}".format("Dave")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module>
        IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

The following example illustrates the real utility of string formatting.
First, we'll try to print a table without using string formatting:

```
print("i\ti**2\ti**3\ti**5\ti**10\ti**20")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i, "\t", i**2, "\t", i**3, "\t", i**5, "\t", 
                i**10, "\t", i**20)
```

This program prints out a table of various powers of the numbers from 1 to 10.
(This assumes that the tab width is 8.  You might see
something even worse than this if you tab width is set to 4.)
In its current form it relies on the tab character ( ``\t``) to align the
columns of values, but this breaks down when the values in the table get larger
than the tab width:

```
        i       i**2    i**3    i**5    i**10   i**20
        1       1       1       1       1       1
        2       4       8       32      1024    1048576
        3       9       27      243     59049   3486784401
        4       16      64      1024    1048576         1099511627776
        5       25      125     3125    9765625         95367431640625
        6       36      216     7776    60466176        3656158440062976
        7       49      343     16807   282475249       79792266297612001
        8       64      512     32768   1073741824      1152921504606846976
        9       81      729     59049   3486784401      12157665459056928801
        10      100     1000    100000  10000000000     100000000000000000000
```

One possible solution would be to change the tab width, but the first column
already has more space than it needs. The best solution would be to set the
width of each column independently. As you may have guessed by now, string
formatting provides a much nicer solution.  We can also right-justify each field:

```
layout = "{0:>4}{1:>6}{2:>6}{3:>8}{4:>13}{5:>24}"

print(layout.format("i", "i**2", "i**3", "i**5", "i**10", "i**20"))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(layout.format(i, i**2, i**3, i**5, i**10, i**20))
```

Running this version produces the following (much more satisfying) output: 

```
       i  i**2  i**3    i**5        i**10                   i**20
       1     1     1       1            1                       1
       2     4     8      32         1024                 1048576
       3     9    27     243        59049              3486784401
       4    16    64    1024      1048576           1099511627776
       5    25   125    3125      9765625          95367431640625
       6    36   216    7776     60466176        3656158440062976
       7    49   343   16807    282475249       79792266297612001

       9    81   729   59049   3486784401    12157665459056928801
      10   100  1000  100000  10000000000   100000000000000000000
