We previously saw that each turtle instance has attributes and methods 
that can be applied to the instance.  For example,
we could set the turtle's color, and we wrote ```tess.turn(90)```.  

Just like a turtle, a string is also an object.  So each string instance 
has attributes and methods.  

```
>>> ss = "Hello, World!"
>>> tt = ss.upper()
>>> tt
'HELLO, WORLD!'
```
    
```upper``` is a method that can be invoked on any string object 
to create a new string, in which all the 
characters are in uppercase.  (The original string ```ss``` remains unchanged.)

There are also methods such as ```lower```, ```capitalize```, and
```swapcase``` that do other interesting stuff.

To learn what methods are available, you can consult the Help documentation, using the command ```help(str)```, look for 
string methods, and read the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str).
