**Practice 1.**  What is the result of each of the following:

```
>>> "Python"[1]
>>> "Strings are sequences of characters."[5]
>>> len("wonderful")
>>> "Mystery"[:4]
>>> "p" in "Pineapple"
>>> "apple" in "Pineapple"
>>> "pear" not in "Pineapple"
>>> "apple" > "pineapple"
>>> "pineapple" < "Peach"
```
    
**Practice 2.** Modify:
```
prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
suffix = "ack"

for letter in prefixes:
    print(letter + suffix)
```

so that ``Ouack`` and ``Quack`` are spelled correctly.
   
**Practice 3.** Encapsulate
```
fruit = "banana"
count = 0
for char in fruit:
    if char == "a":
        count += 1
print(count)
```

in a function named ``count_letters``, and generalize it so that it accepts
the string and the letter as arguments.  Make the function return the number
of characters, rather than print the answer.  The caller should do the printing.
     
**Practice 4.**  Now rewrite the ``count_letters`` function so that instead of traversing the 
   string, it repeatedly calls the ``find`` method, with the optional third parameter 
   to locate new occurrences of the letter being counted.
   
**Practice 5.**  Assign to a variable in your program a triple-quoted string that contains 
your favorite paragraph of text --- perhaps a poem, a speech, instructions
to bake a cake, some inspirational verses, etc.

Write a function that removes all punctuation from the string, breaks the string
into a list of words, and counts the number of words in your text that contain
the letter "e".  Your program should print an analysis of the text like this:

```   
Your text contains 243 words, of which 109 (44.8%) contain an "e".      
```

**Practice 6.** Print out a neatly formatted multiplication table, up to 12 x 12.

**Practice 7.** Write a function that reverses its string argument, and satisfies these tests:

```
test(reverse("happy") == "yppah")
test(reverse("Python") == "nohtyP")
test(reverse("") == "")
test(reverse("a") == "a")
```

**Practice 8.** Write a function that mirrors its argument:

```
test(mirror("good") == "gooddoog")
test(mirror("Python") == "PythonnohtyP")
test(mirror("") == "")
test(mirror("a") == "aa")
```

**Practice 9.** Write a function that removes all occurrences of a given letter from a string:
    
```            
test(remove_letter("a", "apple") == "pple")
test(remove_letter("a", "banana") == "bnn")
test(remove_letter("z", "banana") == "banana")
test(remove_letter("i", "Mississippi") == "Msssspp")
test(remove_letter("b", "") = "")
test(remove_letter("b", "c") = "c")
```

**Practice 10.** Write a function that recognizes palindromes. (Hint: use your ``reverse`` function to make this easy!):

```
test(is_palindrome("abba"))
test(not is_palindrome("abab"))
test(is_palindrome("tenet"))
test(not is_palindrome("banana"))
test(is_palindrome("straw warts"))
test(is_palindrome("a"))
# test(is_palindrome(""))    # Is an empty string a palindrome?
```

**Practice 11.** Write a function that counts how many times a substring occurs in a string: 
   
```
test(count("is", "Mississippi") == 2)
test(count("an", "banana") == 2)
test(count("ana", "banana") == 2)
test(count("nana", "banana") == 1)
test(count("nanan", "banana") == 0)
test(count("aaa", "aaaaaa") == 4)
```

**Practice 12.** Write a function that removes the first occurrence of a string from another string: 

```
test(remove("an", "banana") == "bana")
test(remove("cyc", "bicycle") == "bile")
test(remove("iss", "Mississippi") == "Missippi")
test(remove("eggs", "bicycle") == "bicycle")
```

**Practice 13.** Write a function that removes all occurrences of a string from another string: 

```
test(remove_all("an", "banana") == "ba")
test(remove_all("cyc", "bicycle") == "bile")
test(remove_all("iss", "Mississippi") == "Mippi")
test(remove_all("eggs", "bicycle") == "bicycle")
```
