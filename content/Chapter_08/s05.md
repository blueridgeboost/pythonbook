The comparison operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal:

```
if word == "banana":
    print("Yes, we have no bananas!")
```

Other comparison operations are useful for putting words in
``lexicographical`` order:

```
if word < "banana":
    print("Your word, " + word + ", comes before banana.")
elif word > "banana":
    print("Your word, " + word + ", comes after banana.")
else:
    print("Yes, we have no bananas!")
```

This is similar to the alphabetical order you would use with a dictionary,
except that all the uppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters. As
a result:

```     
Your word, Zebra, comes before banana.
```

A common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a standard
format, such as all lowercase, before performing the comparison. A more
difficult problem is making the program realize that zebras are not fruit.
