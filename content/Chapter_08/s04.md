A *substring* of a string is obtained by taking a **slice**.   Similarly, we can
slice a list to refer to some sublist of the items in the list:
```
>>> s = "Pirates of the Caribbean"
>>> print(s[0:7])
Pirates
>>> print(s[11:14])
the
>>> print(s[15:24])
Caribbean
>>> friends = ["Joe", "Zoe", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]
>>> print(friends[2:4])
['Brad', 'Angelina']
```

The operator ``[n:m]`` returns the part of the string from the n'th character
to the m'th character, including the first but excluding the last. This
behavior makes sense if you imagine the indices
pointing *between* the characters, as in the following diagram:

If you imagine this as a piece of paper, the slice operator ``[n:m]`` copies out
the part of the paper between the ``n`` and ``m`` positions.  Provided ``m`` and ``n`` are
both within the bounds of the string, your result will be of length (m-n).
   
Three tricks are added to this: if you omit the first index (before the colon), 
the slice starts at the beginning of the string (or list). If you omit the second index, 
the slice extends to the end of the string (or list). Similarly, if you provide a value for
``n`` that is bigger than the length of the string (or list), the slice will take all the 
values up to the end. (It won't give an "out of range" error like the normal indexing operation
does.)   Thus:
```
>>> fruit = "banana"
>>> fruit[:3]
'ban'
>>> fruit[3:]
'ana'
>>> fruit[3:999]
'ana'
```

What do you think ``s[:]`` means?   What about ``friends[4:]``?
