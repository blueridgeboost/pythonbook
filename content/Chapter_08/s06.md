It is tempting to use the ``[]`` operator on the left side of an assignment, to change a character in a string.  For example:
```
greeting = "Hello, world!"
greeting[0] = 'J'            # ERROR!
print(greeting)
```

Instead of producing the output ``Jello, world!``, this code produces the
runtime error ``TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment``.

Strings are **immutable**, which means you can't change an existing string. The
best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:

```
greeting = "Hello, world!"
new_greeting = "J" + greeting[1:]
print(new_greeting)
```

The solution here is to concatenate a new first letter onto a slice of
``greeting``. This operation does not change the original string.
