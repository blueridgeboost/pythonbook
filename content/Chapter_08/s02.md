The **indexing operator** (Python uses square brackets to enclose the index) 
selects a single character substring from a string:

```
>>> fruit = "banana"
>>> m = fruit[1]
>>> print(m)
```
        
The expression ```fruit[1]``` selects character number 1 from ```fruit```, and creates a new
string containing just this one character. The variable ```m``` refers to the result. 
When we display ```m```, we could get a surprise. 

Computer scientists always start counting from zero! 
The letter at subscript position zero of ``"banana"`` is ``b``.  So at
position ``[1]`` we have the letter ``a``.

If we want to access the zero-eth letter of a string, we just place 0,
or any expression that evaluates to 0, in between the brackets:
```
>>> m = fruit[0]
>>> print(m)
b
```

The expression in brackets is called an **index**. An index specifies a member
of an ordered collection, in this case, the collection of characters in the string. The index
*indicates* which one you want, hence the name. It can be any integer
expression.

We can use ```enumerate``` to visualize the indices:

```
>>> fruit = "banana"
>>> list(enumerate(fruit))
[(0, 'b'), (1, 'a'), (2, 'n'), (3, 'a'), (4, 'n'), (5, 'a')]
```

Do not worry about ```enumerate``` at this point, we will see more of it
in the chapter on lists.

Note that indexing returns a *string* --- Python has no special type for a single character.
It is just a string of length 1.

We've also seen lists previously.  The same indexing notation works to extract elements from
a list: 
```
>>> prime_nums = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]
>>> prime_nums[4]
11
>>> friends = ["Joe", "Zoe", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]
>>> friends[3]
'Angelina'
```
