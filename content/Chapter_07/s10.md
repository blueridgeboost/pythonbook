**Practice 1.** Write a void (non-fruitful) function to draw a square. Use it in a program to draw the image shown below.
Assume each side is 20 units. (Hint: notice that the turtle has already moved away from the ending point of the
last square when the program ends.)

**Practice 2.** Write a program to draw this. Assume the innermost square is 20 units per side, and each successive square is
20 units bigger, per side, than the one inside it.

**Practice 3.** Write a void function ```draw_poly(t, n, sz)``` which makes a turtle draw a regular polygon. When called
with ```draw_poly(tess, 8, 50)```, it will draw a shape like this:

**Practice 4.** Draw this pretty pattern.

**Practice 5.** The two spirals in this picture differ only by the turn angle. Draw both.

**Practice 6.** Write a void function ```draw_equitriangle(t, sz)``` which calls ```draw_poly``` from the previous question
to have its turtle draw an equilateral triangle.

**Practice 7.** Write a fruitful function ```sum_to(n)``` that returns the sum of all integer numbers up to and including ```n```. So
```sum_to(10)``` would be ```1+2+3. . . +10``` which would return the value ```55```.

**Practice 8.** Write a function ```area_of_circle(r)``` which returns the area of a circle of radius ```r``.

**Practice 9.** Write a void function to draw a star, where the length of each side is 100 units. (Hint: You should turn the turtle by 144 degrees at each point.)

**Practice 10.** Extend your program above. Draw five stars, but between each, pick up the pen, move forward by 350 units,
turn right by 144, put the pen down, and draw the next star. You’ll get something like this:
What would it look like if you didn’t pick up the pen?

**Practice 11.** The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function
```turn_clockwise``` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass
point in the clockwise direction. Here are some tests that should pass:
```
>>>turn_clockwise("N") == "E"
True
>>>turn_clockwise("W") == "N"
True
```
You might ask “What if the argument to the function is some other value?” For all other cases, the function
should return the value ```None```.

**Practice 12.** Write a function ```day_name``` that converts an integer number 0 to 6 into the name of a day. Assume day 0 is
“Sunday”. Once again, return ```None``` if the arguments to the function are not valid.

**Practice 13.** Write the inverse function ```day_num``` which is given a day name, and returns its number.
Once again, if this function is given an invalid argument, it should return ```None```.

**Practice 14.** Write a function that helps answer questions like ‘“Today is Wednesday. I leave on holiday in 19 days time.
What day will that be?”’ So the function must take a day name and a delta argument — the number of days
to add— and should return the resulting day name:
```
day_add("Monday", 4) == "Friday"
day_add("Tuesday", 0) == "Tuesday"
day_add("Tuesday", 14) == "Tuesday"
day_add("Sunday", 100) == "Tuesday"
```

Hint: use the first two functions written above to help you write this one.

**Practice 15.** Can your ```day_add``` function already work with negative deltas? For example, -1 would be yesterday, or -7
would be a week ago:
``` 
day_add("Sunday", -1) == "Saturday"
day_add("Sunday", -7) == "Sunday"
day_add("Tuesday", -100) == "Sunday"
```
If your function already works, explain why. If it does not work, make it work.

Hint: Play with some cases of using the modulus function ```%``` (introduced at the beginning of the previous
chapter). Specifically, explore what happens to ```x % 7``` when ```x``` is negative.

**Practice 16.** Write a function ```days_in_month``` which takes the name of a month, and returns the number of days in the
month. Ignore leap years:

```
days_in_month("February") == 28
days_in_month("December") == 31
```

If the function is given invalid arguments, it should return ```None```.

**Practice 17.** Write a function ```to_secs``` that converts hours, minutes and seconds to a total number of seconds. Here are
some tests that should pass:

```
to_secs(2, 30, 10) == 9010
to_secs(2, 0, 0) == 7200
to_secs(0, 2, 0) == 120
to_secs(0, 0, 42) == 42
to_secs(0, -10, 10) == -590
```

**Practice 18.** Extend ```to_secs``` so that it can cope with real values as inputs. It should always return an integer number of
seconds (truncated towards zero):

```
to_secs(2.5, 0, 10.71) == 9010
to_secs(2.433,0,0) == 8758
```

**Practice 19.** Write three functions that are the “inverses” of ```to_secs```:

1. ```hours_in``` returns the whole integer number of hours represented by a total number of seconds.

2. ```minutes_in``` returns the whole integer number of left over minutes in a total number of seconds, once
the hours have been taken out.

3. ```seconds_in``` returns the left over seconds represented by a total number of seconds.

You may assume that the total number of seconds passed to these functions is an integer. Here are some test
cases:

```
hours_in(9010) == 2
minutes_in(9010) == 30
seconds_in(9010) == 10
```

**Practice 19.** Which of these tests fail? Explain why.

```
3 % 4 == 0
3 % 4 == 3
3 / 4 == 0
3 // 4 == 0
3+4 * 2 == 14
4-2+2 == 0
len("hello, world!") == 13
```

**Practice 21.** Write a compare function that returns 1 if a > b, 0 if a == b, and -1 if a < b

```
compare(5, 4) == 1
compare(7, 7) == 0
compare(2, 3) == -1
compare(42, 1) == 1
```

**Practice 22.** Write a function called hypotenuse that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the
lengths of the two legs as parameters:
```
hypotenuse(3, 4) == 5.0
hypotenuse(12, 5) == 13.0
hypotenuse(24, 7) == 25.0
hypotenuse(9, 12) == 15.0
```

**Practice 23.** Write a function ```slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)``` that returns the slope of the line through the points (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2). Be sure your implementation of slope can pass the following tests:

```
slope(5, 3, 4, 2) == 1.0
slope(1, 2, 3, 2) == 0.0
slope(1, 2, 3, 3) == 0.5
slope(2, 4, 1, 2) == 2.0
```

Then use a call to slope in a new function named ```intercept(x1, y1, x2, y2)``` that returns the yintercept
of the line through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)

```
intercept(1, 6, 3, 12) == 3.0
intercept(6, 1, 1, 6) == 7.0
intercept(4, 6, 12, 8) == 5.0
```

**Practice 24.** Write a function called ```is_even(n)``` that takes an integer as an argument and returns ```True``` if the argument is an even number and ```False``` if it is odd.
Add your own tests to the test suite.

**Practice 25.** Now write the function ```is_odd(n)``` that returns ```True``` when ```n``` is odd and ```False``` otherwise. Include unit tests
for this function too.

Finally, modify it so that it uses a call to ```is_even`` to determine if its argument is an odd integer, and ensure
that its test still pass.

**Practice 26.** Write a function ```is_factor(f, n)``` that passes these tests:

```
is_factor(3, 12)
not is_factor(5, 12)
is_factor(7, 14)
not is_factor(7, 15)
is_factor(1, 15)
is_factor(15, 15)
not is_factor(25, 15)
```

**Practice 27.** Write ```is_multiple``` to satisfy these statements using is_factor from the previous execise.

```
is_multiple(12, 3) 
is_multiple(12, 4) 
not is_multiple(12, 5) 
is_multiple(12, 6) 
not is_multiple(12, 7)
```

**Practice 28.** Write the function ```f2c(t)``` designed to return the integer value of the nearest degree Celsius for given temperature
in Fahrenheit. (hint: you may want to make use of the built-in function, ```round```. 

```
f2c(212) == 100 # Boiling point of water
f2c(32) == 0 # Freezing point of water
f2c(-40) == -40 # Wow, what an interesting case!
f2c(36) == 2
f2c(37) == 3
f2c(38) == 3
f2c(39) == 4
```

**Practice 29.** Now do the opposite: write the function ```c2f``` which converts Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```
c2f(0) == 32
c2f(100) == 212
c2f(-40) == -40
c2f(12) == 54
c2f(18) == 64
c2f(-48) == -54
```
