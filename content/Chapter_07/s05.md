All the functions in the previous section return values. Furthermore, functions like ```range```, ```int```, ```abs``` all return values that can be used to build more complex expressions.

So an important difference between these functions and one like ```draw_square``` is that ```draw_square``` was not executed because we wanted it to compute a value — on the contrary, we wrote draw_square because we wanted it to execute a sequence of steps that caused the turtle to draw.

A function that returns a value is called a fruitful function in this book. The opposite of a fruitful function is **void function** — one that is not executed for its resulting value, but is executed because it does something useful. (Languages like Java, C#, C and C++ use the term “void function”, other languages like Pascal call it a procedure.) Even though void functions are not executed for their resulting value, Python always wants to return something. So if the programmer doesn’t arrange to return a value, Python will automatically return the value None.

How do we write our fruitful function? Below is the standard formula for compound interest, which we’ll now write as a fruitful function:

!["Compound Interest"](/pythonbook/images/compoundInterest.png)

```
def final_amt(p, r, n, t):
    """
    Apply the compound interest formula to p
    to produce the final amount.
    """

    a = p * (1 + r/n) ** (n*t)
    return a         # This is new, and makes the function fruitful.

# now that we have the function above, let us call it.
toInvest = float(input("How much do you want to invest?"))
fnl = final_amt(toInvest, 0.08, 12, 5)
print("At the end of the period you will have " + str(fnl))
```

The return statement is followed by an expression (```a``` in this case). This expression will be evaluated and returned to the caller as the “fruit” of calling this function.

We prompted the user for the principal amount. The type of ```toInvest``` is a string, but we need a number before we can work with it. Because it represents money, and could have decimal places, we have used the ```float``` type converter function to parse the string and return a float.

Notice how we entered the arguments for 8% interest, compounded 12 times per year, for 5 years.

When we run this, if you use 10000 as your input, you’ll get the output

At the end of the period you will have 14898.457083

This is a bit messy with all these decimal places, but remember that Python doesn’t understand that we’re working with money: it just does the calculation to the best of its ability, without rounding.

The line ```toInvest = float(input("How much do you want to invest?"))``` also shows yet another example of composition — we can call a function like ```float``, and its arguments can be the results of other function calls (like ```input```) that we have called along the way.

Notice something else very important here. The name of the variable we pass as an argument — ```toInvest``` — has nothing to do with the name of the parameter — ```p```. It is as if ```p = toInvest``` is executed when ```final_amt``` is called. It does not matter what the value was named in the caller, in ```final_amt``` its name is ```p```.

These short variable names are getting quite tricky, so perhaps we would prefer one of these versions instead:

```
def final_amt_v2(principalAmount, nominalPercentageRate,
                     numTimesPerYear, years):
    a = principalAmount * (1 + nominalPercentageRate /
              numTimesPerYear) ** (numTimesPerYear*years)
    return a

def final_amt_v3(amt, rate, compounded, years):
    a = amt * (1 + rate/compounded) ** (componded*years)
    return a
```

They all do the same thing. Use your judgment to write code that can be best understood by other humans! Short variable names are more economical and sometimes make code easier to read: E = mc2 would not be nearly so memorable if Einstein had used longer variable names! If you prefer short names, make sure you also have some comments to enlighten the reader about what the variables are used for.
