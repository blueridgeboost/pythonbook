The built-in functions we have used, such as ```abs```, ```pow```, ```int```, ```max```, and ```range```, have produced results. Calling each of these functions generates a value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.

```
biggest = max(3, 7, 2, 5)
x = abs(3 - 11) + 10
```

We also wrote a function to return the final amount for a compound interest calculation.

We are going to write more functions that return values, which we will call fruitful functions, for want of a better name. The first example is ```area```, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:

```
def area(radius):
    b = 3.14159 * radius**2
    return b
```

We have seen the return statement before: in a fruitful function the return statement includes a return value. This statement means: evaluate the return expression, and then return it immediately as the result (the fruit) of this function. The expression provided can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could have written this function like this:

```
def area(radius):
    return 3.14159 * radius * radius
```

On the other hand, temporary variables like ```b``` above often make debugging easier.
