Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization. For example, if we want to find the absolute value of a number, we have to indicate what the number is. Python has a built-in function for computing the absolute value:

```
>>> abs(5)
5
>>> abs(-5)
5
```

In this example, the arguments to the ```abs``` function are ```5``` and ```-5```.

Some functions take more than one argument. For example, the built-in function pow takes two arguments, the base and the exponent. Inside the function, the values that are passed get assigned to variables called parameters.

```
>>> pow(2, 3)
8
>>> pow(7, 4)
2401
```

Another built-in function that takes more than one argument is ```max```.

```
>>> max(7, 11)
11
>>> max(4, 1, 17, 2, 12)
17
>>> max(3 * 11, 5**3, 512 - 9, 1024**0)
503
```

```max``` can be passed any number of arguments, separated by commas, and will return the largest value passed. The arguments can be either simple values or expressions. In the last example, ```503``` is returned, since it is larger than ```33```, ```125```, and ```1```.
