When we create a local variable inside a function, it only exists inside the function, and we cannot use it outside. For example, consider again this function:

```
def final_amt(p, r, n, t):
    a = p * (1 + r/n) ** (n*t)
    return a
```

If we try to use ```a```, outside the function, we will get an error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<pyshell#12>", line 1, in <module>
        a
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

The variable ```a``` is local to ```final_amt```, and is not visible outside the function.

Additionally, ```a``` only exists while the function is being executed â€” we call this its lifetime. When the execution of the function terminates, the local variables are destroyed.

Parameters are also local, and act like local variables. For example, the lifetimes of ```p```, ```r```, ```n```, ```t``` begin when ```final_amt``` is called, and the lifetime ends when the function completes its execution.

So it is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a value, complete its execution, and then when it is called again next time, recover the local variable. Each call of the function creates new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller.
