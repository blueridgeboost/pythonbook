At this point, you should be able to look at complete functions and tell what they do. Also, you have already written some small functions. As you write larger functions, you might start to have more difficulty, especially with runtime and semantic errors.

To deal with increasingly complex programs, we are going to suggest a technique called incremental development. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.

As an example, suppose we want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:

![Distance formula](/pythonbook/images/distance_formula.png)

Do not worry if you do not know this formula or how to prove it. We are just going to worry about how to implement it in Python.

The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?

In this case, the two points are the inputs, which we can represent using four parameters. The return value is the distance, which is a floating-point value.

Already we can write an outline of the function that captures our thinking so far:

```
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
   return 0.0
```

Obviously, this version of the function does not compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it will run, which means that we can test it before we make it more complicated.

To test the new function, we call it with sample values:

```
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return 0.0
 
print(distance(1,2,4,6))
```

We chose these values so that the horizontal distance equals 3 and the vertical distance equals 4; that way, the result is 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle). When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.

At this point, we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding lines of code. After each incremental change, we test the function again. If an error occurs at any point, we know where it must be — in the last line we added.

A logical first step in the computation is to find the differences ```x2 - x1``` and ```y2 - y1```. We will refer to those values using temporary variables named ```dx``` and ```dy```.

```
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    return 0.0
 
print(distance(1,2,4,6))
```

If we call the function with the arguments shown above when the flow of execution gets to the return statement, ```dx``` should be 3 and ```dy``` should be 4. We can check that this is the case by putting in temporary print statements in the function, like so:

```
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    print("dx = "+str(dx))
    print("dy = "+str(dy))
    return 0.0
 
print(distance(1,2,4,6))
```

Now we can confirm that the function is getting the right parameters and performing the first computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check. Once we’re sure that dx and dy are working correctly, we should remove the temporary print statements — we do not want them in our final program.

Next, we compute the sum of squares of ```dx``` and ```dy```:

```
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy
    return 0.0

print(distance(1,2,4,6))
```

Again, we could put in a temporary print statement, then run the program at this stage and check the value of ```dsquared``` (which should be 25):

```
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy
    print("dsquared = "+str(dsquared))
    return 0.0

print(distance(1,2,4,6))
```

Finally, using the fractional exponent 0.5 to find the square root, we compute and return the result:

```
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy
    result = dsquared**0.5
    return result
 
print(distance(1,2,4,6))
```

If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to inspect the value of ```result``` before the return statement.

When you start out, you might add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger conceptual chunks. Either way, stepping through your code one line at a time and verifying that each step matches your expectations can save you a lot of debugging time. As you improve your programming skills you should find yourself managing bigger and bigger chunks: this is very similar to the way we learned to read letters, syllables, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc., or the way we learn to chunk music — from individual notes to chords, bars, phrases, and so on.

The key aspects of the process are:

Start with a working skeleton program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you will know exactly where it is.

Use temporary variables to refer to intermediate values so that you can easily inspect and check them.

Once the program is working, relax, sit back, and play around with your options. (There is interesting research that links “playfulness” to better understanding, better learning, more enjoyment, and a more positive mindset about what you can achieve — so spend some time fiddling around!) 

You might want to consolidate multiple statements into one bigger compound expression, or rename the variables you’ve used, or see if you can make the function shorter. A good guideline is to aim for making code as easy as possible for others to read.
Here is another version of the function. It makes use of a square root function that is in the math module. Which do you prefer? Which looks “closer” to the Pythagorean formula we started out with?

```
import math

def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
 
print(distance(1,2,4,6))
```

As we saw in the example above, a powerful technique for debugging is to insert extra ```print``` functions in carefully selected places in your code. Then, by inspecting the output of the program, you can check whether the algorithm is doing what you expect it to. Be clear about the following, however:

You must have a clear solution to the problem and must know what should happen before you can debug a program. Work on solving the problem on a piece of paper (perhaps using a flowchart to record the steps you take) before you concern yourself with writing code. Writing a program doesn’t solve the problem — it simply automates the manual steps you would take. So first make sure you have a pen-and-paper manual solution that works. Programming then is about making those manual steps happen automatically.

Do not write chatterbox functions. A chatterbox is a fruitful function that, in addition to its primary task, also asks the user for input, or prints output, when it would be more useful if it simply shut up and did its work quietly.

For example, we’ve seen built-in functions like range, max and abs. None of these would be useful building blocks for other programs if they prompted the user for input, or printed their results while they performed their tasks.

So a good tip is to avoid calling print and input functions inside fruitful functions unless the primary purpose of your function is to perform input and output. The exception to this rule is to temporarily sprinkle some calls to print into your code to help debug and understand what is happening when the code runs, but these will then be removed once you get things working.
