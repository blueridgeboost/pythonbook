Now that we have fruitful functions, we can focus our attention on reorganizing our code so that it fits more nicely into our mental chunks. This process of rearrangement is called refactoring the code.

Two things we will always want to do when working with turtles are to create the window for the turtle, and to create one or more turtles. For example, we could write some functions to make these tasks easier in the future:

```
def make_window(colr, ttle):
    """
     Set up the window with the given background color and title.
     Returns the new window.
    """
    turtle.clearscreen()           # Remove drawings from previous runs.
    turtle.setup(200, 100)         # Sets the dimensions of the viewing window.
    
    turtle.bgcolor(colr)
    turtle.title(ttle)

def make_turtle(colr, sz):
    """
     Set up a turtle with the given color and pensize.
     Returns the new turtle.
    """
    t = turtle.Turtle()
    t.color(colr)
    t.pensize(sz)
    return t
```

Then we could make new turtles easily, like so:

```
make_window("lightgreen", "Tess and Alex dancing")
tess = make_turtle("hotpink", 5)
alex = make_turtle("black", 1)
dave = make_turtle("yellow", 2)
```

The trick about refactoring code is to anticipate which things we are likely to want to change each time we call the function: these should become the parameters, or changeable parts, of the functions we write.
