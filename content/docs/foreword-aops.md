# Foreword-AoPS Edition

Welcome to the AoPS Edition of *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3*!

This ebook is designed for use with the Art of Problem Solving&#8217;s 
[Introduction to Programming with Python](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/School/courseinfo.php?course_id=python1) and [Intermediate Programming with Python](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/School/courseinfo.php?course_id=python2) courses. We assume that students taking the Introduction course have no prior programming experience, and that students taking the Intermediate course have a basic knowledge of Python.

This ebook merges material from two sources:
- The open-source textbook *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3 (RLE)*, by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers. This book is available at [http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)
- The *Runestone Interactive* tools, by the Runestone Interactive Project at Luther University. These tools are available at [http://interactivepython.org](http://interactivepython.org)

We have, by and large, taken the text from the first source above and added the interactive tools from the second source. This means that the people listed above did 90% of the work for us, and for that we are very grateful. Our work consisted mostly of making some edits of the book&#8217;s content to make it more suitable for our AoPS audience, and changing a few features of the interactive tools to meet the content needs.
