## Logical opposites

Each of the six relational operators has a logical opposite: for example,
suppose we can get a driver&#8217;s licence when our age is greater or equal to 16,
we can *not* get the driver&#8217;s licence when we are less than 16.

Notice that the opposite of ```>=``` is ```<```.

<div><table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="67%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">operator</th>
<th class="head">logical opposite</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>==</td>
<td>!=</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>!=</td>
<td>==</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><</td>
<td>>=</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><=</td>
<td>></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>></td>
<td><=</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>>=</td>
<td><</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Understanding these logical opposites allows us to sometimes get rid of ```not```
operators.  ```not``` operators are often quite difficult to read in computer code, and
our intentions will usually be clearer if we can eliminate them.

For example, if we wrote this Python:

```
if not (age >= 17):
    print("Hey, you are too young to get a driver's licence!")
```

it would probably be clearer to use the simplification laws, and to
write instead:

```
if age < 17:
    print("Hey, you are too young to get a driver's licence!")
```


**Exercise 14.** Give the logical opposites of these conditions

1. a > b
2. a >= b
3. a >= 18 and day == 3
4. a >= 18 and day != 3
