## Boolean functions

Functions can return Boolean values, which is often convenient for hiding
complicated tests inside functions. For example:


```
def is_divisible(x, y):
    """ Test if x is exactly divisible by y """
    if x % y == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(is_divisible(10,5))  # should print True
print(is_divisible(10,7))  # should print False
```


It is common to give **Boolean
functions** names that sound like yes/no questions.  ```is_divisible``` returns
either ```True``` or ```False``` to indicate whether the ```x``` is or is not
divisible by ```y```.

We can make the function more concise by taking advantage of the fact that the
condition of the ```if``` statement is itself a Boolean expression. We can return
it directly, avoiding the ```if``` statement altogether:


```
def is_divisible(x, y):
    """ Test if x is exactly divisible by y """
    return x % y == 0

print(is_divisible(10,5))  # should print True
print(is_divisible(10,7))  # should print False
```

Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:

```
if is_divisible(x, y):
    ... # Do something ...
else:
    ... # Do something else ...
```

It might be tempting to write something like:


```
if is_divisible(x, y) == True:
```

but the extra comparison is unnecessary.
