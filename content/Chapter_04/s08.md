## Type conversion

We&#8217;ve had a first look at this in an earlier chapter.  Seeing it again won&#8217;t hurt!

Many Python types come with a built-in function that attempts to convert values
of another type into its own type. The ```int``` function, for example,
takes any value and converts it to an integer, if possible, or complains
otherwise:

```
>>> int("32")
32
>>> int("Hello")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#6>", line 1, in <module>
    int("hello")
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: &#39;hello&#39;
```

```int``` can also convert floating-point values to integers, but remember
that it truncates the fractional part:


```
>>> int(-2.3)
-2
>>> int(3.99999)
3
>>> int("42")
42
>>> int(1.0)
1
```

The ```float``` function converts integers and strings to floating-point
numbers:


```
>>> float(32)
32.0
>>> float("3.14159")
3.14159
>>> float(1)
1.0
```

It may seem odd that Python distinguishes the integer value ```1``` from the
floating-point value ```1.0```. They may represent the same number, but they
belong to different types. The reason is that they are represented differently
inside the computer.

The ```str``` function converts any argument given to it to type
```string```:


```
>>> str(32)
&#39;32&#39;
>>> str(3.14149)
&#39;3.14149&#39;
>>> str(True)
&#39;True&#39;
>>> str(true)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#7>", line 1, in <module>
    str(true)
NameError: name &#39;true&#39; is not defined
```

```str``` will work with any value and convert it into a string.  As
mentioned earlier, ```True``` is Boolean value; ```true``` is just an ordinary variable name,
and is not defined here, so we get an error.

## Boolean functions

Functions can return Boolean values, which is often convenient for hiding
complicated tests inside functions. For example:


```
def is_divisible(x, y):
    """ Test if x is exactly divisible by y """
    if x % y == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(is_divisible(10,5))  # should print True
print(is_divisible(10,7))  # should print False
```


It is common to give **Boolean
functions** names that sound like yes/no questions.  ```is_divisible``` returns
either ```True``` or ```False``` to indicate whether the ```x``` is or is not
divisible by ```y```.

We can make the function more concise by taking advantage of the fact that the
condition of the ```if``` statement is itself a Boolean expression. We can return
it directly, avoiding the ```if``` statement altogether:


```
def is_divisible(x, y):
    """ Test if x is exactly divisible by y """
    return x % y == 0

print(is_divisible(10,5))  # should print True
print(is_divisible(10,7))  # should print False
```

Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:

```
if is_divisible(x, y):
    ... # Do something ...
else:
    ... # Do something else ...
```

It might be tempting to write something like:


```
if is_divisible(x, y) == True:
```

but the extra comparison is unnecessary.
