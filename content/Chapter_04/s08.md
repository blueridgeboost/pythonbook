**Exercise 14.** A bunny leaves the forest and starts to run over the meadow at a constant speed ```v1```. After a time ```t0``` a wolf appears at the edge of the forest and starts chasing the bunny at a constant speed ```v1```. Write a program that displays either the time it takes the wolf to catch the bunny or ```-1``` if the wolf never catches the bunny.

**Exercise 15.** What is the output of the code below?

```
a = 17
b = 8
a = a + b 
b = a - b
a = a-b
print(a, b)
```

**Exercise 16.** What is the output of the code below?

```
a = 1234
b = a % 100
a = a//100
c = b*100 + a
print(c)
```

**Exercise 17.** Which expressions are true if and only if ```x``` is a negative integer?

a. ```(x%2==1) and (x<0)```

b. ```(x%2!=0) or (x<0)```

c. ```not((x%2==0) or (x>=0) )```

d. ```not((x%2==0) and (x>=0) )```

**Exercise 18.** Which expressions are true if and only if ```x``` and ```y``` are consecutive positive integers?

a. ```x-y==1```

b. ```(x==1) and (y==2)```

c. ```(x-y == -1) and (y-x == 1)```

d. ```(x-y==1) or (y-x==1)```
