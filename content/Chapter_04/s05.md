## Conditional execution

In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check
conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. **Conditional
statements** give us this ability. The simplest form is the **if**
statement:

```
x = 8

if x % 2 == 0:
    print(str(x)+" is even.")
    print("Did you know that 2 is the only even number that is prime?")
else:
    print(str(x)+" is odd.")
    print("Did you know that multiplying two odd numbers " +
                             "always gives an odd result?")                          
```


Try changing the value of ```x``` in the above program, and see how the output changes.

The Boolean expression after the ```if``` statement is called the **condition**.
If it is true, then all the indented statements get executed. If not, then all
the statements indented under the ```else``` clause get executed.

The syntax for an ```if``` statement looks like this:

```
if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENTS_1        # Executed if condition evaluates to True
else:
    STATEMENTS_2        # Executed if condition evaluates to False
```

As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound
statements like ```for```, the ```if``` statement consists of a header line and a body. The header
line begins with the keyword ```if``` followed by a *Boolean expression* and ends with
a colon (:).

The indented statements that follow are called a **block**. The first
unindented statement marks the end of the block.

Each of the statements inside the first block of statements are executed in order if the Boolean
expression evaluates to ```True```. The entire first block of statements
is skipped if the Boolean expression evaluates to ```False```, and instead
all the statements indented under the ```else``` clause are executed.

There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear under the two clauses of an
```if``` statement, but there has to be at least one statement in each block.  Occasionally, it is useful
to have a section with no statements (usually as a place keeper, or scaffolding,
for code we haven&#8217;t written yet). In that case, we can use the ```pass``` statement, which
does nothing except act as a placeholder.


```
if True:          # This is always True,
    pass          #   so this is always executed, but it does nothing
else:
    pass
```

## Omitting the ```else``` clause

Another form of the ```if``` statement is one in which the ```else``` clause is omitted entirely.
In this case, when the condition evaluates to ```True```, the statements are
executed, otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the ```if```.

```
x = 36
if x < 0:
    print("The negative number "+str(x)+" is not valid here.")
    x = 42
    print("I've decided to use the number 42 instead.")
print("The square root of "+str(x)+" is "+str(x**0.5))
```

In this case, the print function that outputs the square root is the one after the ```if``` block.  As the code is originally written, the condition of the ```if``` statement is ```False```, so the block of code inside the ```if``` block gets skipped. Change the value of ```x``` to something negative and run it again to see the difference.

Python terminology

Python documentation sometimes uses the term **suite** of statements to mean what we
have called a *block* here. They mean the same thing, and since most other languages and
computer scientists use the word *block*, we&#8217;ll stick with that.

<p class="last">Notice too that ```else``` is not a statement.  The ```if``` statement has
two *clauses*, one of which is the (optional) ```else``` clause.

## Chained conditionals

Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two
branches. One way to express a computation like that is a **chained
conditional**:

```
if x < y:
    STATEMENTS_A
elif x > y:
    STATEMENTS_B
else:
    STATEMENTS_C
```

</div>

```elif``` is an abbreviation of ```else if```. Again, exactly one branch will be
executed. There is no limit of the number of ```elif``` statements but only a
single (and optional) final ```else``` statement is allowed and it must be the last
branch in the statement:

```
if choice == "a":
    function_one()
elif choice == "b":
    function_two()
elif choice == "c":
    function_three()
else:
    print("Invalid choice.")
```

Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked,
and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the
statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true
branch executes.

## Nested conditionals

One conditional can also be **nested** within another. (It is the same theme of
composability, again!)  We could have written
the previous example as follows:

Flowchart of this nested conditional

<img alt="/pythonbook/images/flowchart_nested_conditional.png" class="last" src="/pythonbook/images/flowchart_nested_conditional.png" />
</div>

```
if x < y:
    STATEMENTS_A
else:
    if x > y:
        STATEMENTS_B
    else:
        STATEMENTS_C
```

The outer conditional contains two branches.
The second branch contains another ```if``` statement, which
has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain
conditional statements as well.

Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested
conditionals very quickly become difficult to read.  In general, it is a good
idea to avoid them when we can.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional
statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a single
conditional:

```
if 0 < x:            # Assume x is an int here
    if x < 10:
        print("x is a positive single digit.")</textarea>
```

The ```print``` function is called only if we make it past both the
conditionals, so instead of the above which uses two ```if``` statements each with
a simple condition, we could make a more complex condition using the ```and``` operator.  Now we only
need a single ```if``` statement:


```
if 0 < x and x < 10: # Assume x is an int here
    print("x is a positive single digit.")
```
