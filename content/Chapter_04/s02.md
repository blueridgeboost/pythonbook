## Logical operators

There are three **logical operators**,  ```and```, ```or```, and ```not```,
that allow us to build more complex
Boolean expressions from simpler Boolean expressions. The
semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English.
For example, ```x > 0 and x < 10``` evaluates to ```True``` only if ```x``` is greater than 0 *and*
at the same time, x is less than 10.

```n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0``` is ```True``` if *either* of the conditions is ```True```,
that is if the number ```n``` is divisible by 2 *or* it is divisible by 3.  What do
you think happens if ```n``` is divisible by both 2 and by 3 at the same time?
Will the expression yield ```True``` or ```False```?  Let's try it:


```
n = 6
print(n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0)
```

Finally, the ```not``` operator negates a Boolean value, so ```not (x > y)```
is ```True``` if ```(x > y)``` is ```False```, that is, if ```x``` is less than or equal to
```y```.

The expression on the left of the ```or``` operator is evaluated first: if the result is ```True```,
Python does not (and need not) evaluate the expression on the right. This is called *short-circuit evaluation*.
Similarly, for the ```and``` operator, if the expression on the left yields ```False```, Python does not
evaluate the expression on the right.   In this way, there are no unnecessary evaluations.

**Exercise 7.** Give the logical opposites of these conditions

1. a > b
2. a >= b
3. a >= 18 and day == 3
4. a >= 18 and day != 3

**Exercise 8.** To what values do these expressions evaluate?
1. 3 == 3
2. 3 != 3
3. 3 >= 4
4. not (3 < 4)
