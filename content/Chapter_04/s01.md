## Boolean values and expressions

A *Boolean* value is either true or false.  It is named
after the British mathematician, George Boole, who first formulated *Boolean
Algebra* &#8212; some rules for reasoning about and combining these values.
This is the basis of all modern computer logic.

In Python, the two Boolean values are ```True``` and ```False```, and the Python type is **bool**.
Remember, to find the type of a constant or variable use the function ```type```. Execution of ```type(True)``` reports ```<class "bool">```

The capitalization of ```True``` and ```False``` is imporant. Execution of ```type(true)``` report this error:
```
>>> 
NameError  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-6f4d8242c3d0> in <cell line: 1>()
----> 1 type(true)

NameError: name 'true' is not defined
```

The error tells us that the lowercase ```true``` is an unknown name in Python. 


A **Boolean expression** is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is
a Boolean value.  For example, the operator ```==``` tests if two values are equal.
It produces (or *yields*) a Boolean value.

Consider the statement ``` 5 == (3 + 2)```. The two operands evaluate to equal values, so the expression evaluates to ```True```. 

In the statement ```5 == 6```, 5 is not equal to 6, so we get ```False```.

The ```==``` operator is one of six common **comparison operators** which all produce
a ```bool``` result; here are all six:

```
x == y               # Produce True if ... x is equal to y
x != y               #                 ... x is not equal to y
x > y                #                 ... x is greater than y
x < y                #                 ... x is less than y
x >= y               #                 ... x is greater than or equal to y
x <= y               #                 ... x is less than or equal to y
```

Although these operations are probably familiar, the Python symbols are
different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single
equal sign (```=```) instead of a double equal sign (```==```). Remember that ```=```
is an assignment operator and ```==``` is a comparison operator. Also, there is
no such thing as ```=<``` or ```=>```.

Like any other types seen so far, Boolean values can be assigned to
variables, printed, etc.

The program below outputs ```True```.
```
age = 18
oldEnoughToGetDriversLicense = age >= 16
print(oldEnoughToGetDriversLicense)
```
