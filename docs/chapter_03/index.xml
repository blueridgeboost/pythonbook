      <description>There are many modules in Python that provide very powerful features that we can use in our own programs. Some of these can send email, or fetch web pages. The one we’ll look at in this chapter allows us to create turtles and get them to draw shapes and patterns.
The turtles are fun, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves a little more Python, and to develop our theme of computational thinking, or thinking like a computer scientist.</description>

      <description>Programs get really interesting when we can test conditions and change the program behavior depending on the outcome of the tests. That’s what this chapter is about.
Boolean values and expressions A Boolean value is either true or false. It is named after the British mathematician, George Boole, who first formulated Boolean algebra — some rules for reasoning about and combining these values. This is the basis of all modern computer logic.</description>

      <description>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.
Repeated execution of a set of statements is called iteration. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier. We’ve already seen the for statement: this the the form of iteration you’ll likely be using most often. But in this chapter we’ve going to look at the while statement: another way to have your program do iteration, useful in slightly different circumstances.</description>
